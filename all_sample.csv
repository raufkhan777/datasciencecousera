“driver’s seat” bake at to degrees fahrenheit for to hours the lower the temperature the longer but with the higher temperature you run the risk of browning of course there’s no harm in browning them if you don’t mind the color or if you are going to cover them completely with paint could i get some help when i ask this of my class of rd thru th graders at awana every hand raises before i even say what i need help with but when we stand at the pulpit and ask for help from the congregation…not near so many hands are raised sometimes it feels like pulling teeth to get people to help out rm one of my dear coworkers lamented that she can't make gravy to save her life i wonder why gravy is one of the easiest things to make you just have to follow a few basic rules for one it's that brown stuff that sticks to the bottom of the roasting pan that has gives gravy such great flavor in culinary terms it's called fond to me it's gold next you want a rich and flavorful stock and fond is what makes it happen water doesn't cut it last but just as important you need to know how to thicken the gravy this is where the lumpy gravy fear factor comes in oh i've made plenty of lumpy gravy over the

i like somebody’s dad next time you are in church or driving in the car or walking in the mall and your mind starts to wandering and people watching stop and think we do believe in jesus who was scarred by a crown of thorns and pierced for us – jesus loves us just as much as he loves them by his wounds all prejudice judgment narrowmindedness and intolerance are gone his peace was given to us through his punishment we are all held in his arms – including the different strokes for different folks when we call out to him the original “pierced” son heals us – all here is a pic of the first

enlightenment experiences because we’re supposed to be serving could you comment on that am i correct in that or am i incorrect could you comment to readers about what they can expect what would we

moons that can have a sort of gravitational pull on everything around them but now it is like they are planets spinning off from their orbits nondirectional and ineffective one thing is women do not

can do is raise a kid and even harder is raising a kid right and saving the world from the addition of one more ahole this is of such monumental importance in my opinion that it does indeed take a

the greatest thing on earth tomorrow only may bride bikini is offering our amazing customers a discount off your entire purchase letting go is an incredible concept to learn i know this personally i literally could not let go of the bed rail while in labor with my second child i may have looked fully relaxed but my hand was holding on to that rail for dear life i felt that if i were to let go the power of the contractions would physically sweep me off the bed i was afraid the contractions were stronger than my mind’s ability to control my body but only when i was able to consciously give up my mind’s control over my body and let go of the bed rail then i was able to move forward in my labor and bring something new into my life in life it can be the same only when we release our attempts to control what is not ours to control do we have the ability to move on it took me a long time to be able to release my tight grasp of control on my life and just let it flow through god’s river that is his plan for me letting go of our fears of the things we can’t change of our past and our plans for the future letting go and letting god take over can be hard but it is what will usher us through the transition into a new phase of life and the end result is worth it whoever chose the word “troll” to describe the modern internet plague was definitely a frood who knew where his towel was at not only because it captures the spirit of their vicious attacks and gnarly stench but because trolls have always preyed on those who dared stray from the path not in vain are they an integral part of the

is quite happy to scribble insults in his column and print outright lies he certainly isn't keen to defend these views or actions face to face in front of either a radio or live audience this is odd

circumstances during the holiday season full of family activities andor work parties where alcohol is going to be served my suggestion is to take your own preference of nonalcoholic beverage or drink nonalcoholic beverages that are served there at the event my all time favorite is the shirley temple drink i bring the ingredients with meginger ale and a jar of cherries with the cherry juice still in it simple and easy we got to be at the orphanage almost the whole day we got there around and we got to stay until around so we packed some bottled waters and some lunch food yes granola bars and

godlike boy at the finale of mass effect are definitely artistically tied however the god child is not the object or result of the game as it is in kubric's and clarke's masterpiece in the star child is the object of david bowman's surrealistic and abstract journeythe unknown unseen and incredibly highly evolved entities evolve bowman into something more similar to themselves the protagonist is

after school time spent with sydney i picked her up at her sitter's house and we went off on an adventure papa was at the farm spraying our grapes mcelwee picks up the narration after leacock begins it effectively beginning the film's transition he describes how sherman destroyed atlanta columbia sc and thousands of smaller towns burning homes plundering cattle and leaving an unprecedented path of destruction before bringing about a confederate surrender in north carolina as mcelwee notes sherman's march marked the first time in modern warfare where a campaign had been waged primarily against a civilian population the director informs us that he first conceived the idea for the documentary about a decade before he actually filmed it thinking it would be interesting to look at sherman's lingering influence in the south and on southerners he shares the tale of an aunt who keeps in her attic an ancestor's couch which still bears the puncture holes from the swords of sherman's troops who were searching for hidden loot when mcelwee finally received a grant that would allow him to fund such a documentary before he returned to his boston home to prepare he stopped first in new york to share the good news with the woman that he'd been seeing unfortunately for ross when he arrived she informed him that she'd reconciled with her exboyfriend knocking mcelwee for a loop he stayed in new york after they argued for awhile taking refuge in a friend's vacant loft eventually he decides to head south to see his family and begin his film but william tecumseh sherman's starring role has been usurped and the sherman's march's title card makes its appearance followed by a subtitle added to more accurately reflect the documentary's broader scope in terms of subject matter the internet and new technologies have helped to connect marginalized groups and give the power of production to oppositional narratives however it is important to remember that as communication technology allows for globalized efforts against the growing forces of capitalism the connections are taking place on products that are a part of a very exploitative and environmentally damaging globalized process this is a process of outsourcing labor exploiting mineral resources and exporting hazardous waste that poisons whole communities from their air to their drinking water it is important to understand where globalization from the bottom is taking place and that is in the middle of a globalization that is in the hands of multinational corporations i know white phones are a bit ‘ooh look at me’ but i felt like i wanted a change from the usual black colour of my desire s so anyway i didn’t go for it in the end i think i’m going to hold out and see what samsung have to

yesterday morning at rugby rowing i had a lovely time sewing away in my wee corner listening to coldplayit was wonderful hopefully i'll get the projects finished tomorrow so i'll have something to

with her looks and the way she was ageing i am currently sat here absolutely devastated as our laptop will not turn on this morning we have photos on there that haven't been backed up or moved onto

across arghhhh sob sob he wasn't elected he doesn't represent the greek people in a fashion that we are used to – running for election and winning the election he was foisted on the greek people by

have until sunday to turn in your dioramas and mine are not eligible for prizes because even that is a bit too narcissistic for me imagine how hilarious that would be though if i made contests for you guys and declared myself the winner every time the point of this discussion is to emphasize the value of opposition as well as the discernment to distinguish between the good and the bad simply abstaining from all forms of aggression is not the answer and inevitably develops into a failure to relate to society life is challenging taking away that natural development is hazardous to early development and is not naturally remedied in the complexities of adulthood if we as a society desire to cultivate mature and well rounded adults we shouldn’t be so quick to shelter them from the value

their bodies and then finding themselves still alive decide what to make of their battered selves although it appears for the longest time that puri with his idealism his love of language his political vision and his diligence is the book’s hero we see him gradually sinking over a thousand pages under the weight of his own worldly power in the new indian republic and somewhat insecure masculinity – an unforgettable narrative arc revealingly it is his involvement with the indian national congress that gradually leaches the idealism from puri so my sammich and fries are here and i'm

website and youtube channel you can also follow her on twitter officialelsie there are so many things i'm thankful for this week i think the gay men of the london media set and their equivalents like dan savage and andrew sullivan in america are feeling very insecure at the moment bless them because the fact is people don't care as much as they used to about who has sex with whom and how we actually live in quite openminded times and this is not very good for gay men's sense of being special and specially oppressed i love the word queer too but that is too subversive for many and suzanne

exgay we discussed how those of us who have been through reparative therapies and exgay ministries need an opportunity to put on the record what we did why we did it what were the outcomes so many other people have told our stories for us but in the act of sharing it for ourselves we can get more clarity and get a little bit more beyond our often harmful experiences to alter our orientation or gender differences caught by my marketing intern with a run away camera this section is designed to advance the efficiency of motorcycles homosexuals have chosen the word “gay” a word that means “happy” or “a lively merry mood” or “bright showy” to describe their lifestyle in homosexuality’s portrayal in the media and in its publicity by its advocates that’s what it can appear to be a funloving free lifestyle yet this is only a mirage over the years in every interaction i have had with a person calling their lifestyle “gay” that same angry fire that my bookstore acquaintance had could be seen in their eyes whether it’s been a onetime opportunity to interact with someone who has identified himself as gay or the longerterm weekly counseling of a man who claimed hundreds of partners and looked as if it were true a belowthesurface seething anger has always been present i cut an oval in the card using a large oval nestie then i cut nestability labels one was stamped with

ecclesiastes lays out solomon’s great work and the results they're hot i have to laugh now although i wasn't finding it overly amusing the night i made it but looking back at krista's post regarding the meal she mentioned that her kids were not big fans of the gravy ironically my kids and i all really enjoyed the chicken gravy and all although i did put it sparingly on my kids' chickenit was my husband who didn't seem to care for it not overly surprisinghe's the pickiest eater in our home he thought the onion flavor was too overpowering here's the thingi fully admit that i've had onions that were very strong and while i happen to enjoy the flavor of onion there have been times in which i've scraped off some excess because it was in fact too overpowering by no means did i think the onion flavor was too muchit was actually a very mild onion he kills me too because he asked me are the onions cooked ummmmyeahby two different methods not only did i saute them but they were then baked within the sauce for about minutes while my chicken was in the oven he even watched me take the chicken out with the sauce covering it i love him dearly but he drives me crazy sometimes i've mentioned this in prior posts but before we started dating about years ago he literally ate the same meal rotation he never would have considered eating onions before i started cooking for him but he will eat them in certain dishes now as far as this dish is concerned i'm honestly not sure if it was more in his head just because he previously had himself convinced that he didn't like onions and this chicken was obviously smothered in them if he'd be willing to try it again perhaps i'll try a vidalia oniondoesn't get much more mild than that in the meantime i'm going to enjoy devouring the leftovers all by myself a glimpse of what all this has cost the us economy can be seen by looking north to canada where animal spirits have been unleashed in the energy sector canada’s close economic ties to the us have traditionally meant that when the us gets the sniffles canada gets swine flu this time it’s been different part of the reason is that canada’s housing market was not poisoned by a federal government push to put unqualified borrowers into homes they could not afford after the collapse of the housing bubble in the us the canadian financial sector remained strong so my blogging is becoming more and more sporadic is that how it will always be or will i settle into a rhythm and start thinking and reflecting again in some sense the whole business feels of a piece with voting more ignorance more obligation to appreciate the process and participate in order to be a responsible citizen i spent part of yesterday doing research trying to dig up dirt on candidates and understand the propositions on california's ballot it was unpleasant i feel okay about some decisions less so about others was i responsible and a good citizen i don't know comment on my posts just once each ux

that day remains very clear and distinct in my mind in waiting to hear the results of the election what must have been only a few minutes felt completely infinite as if i was waiting for hours i had made myself vulnerable to my chapter sisters for what truly was the first time in waiting to hear the news i was on the verge of tears in my years i had never had much success with stuff like this

for steam to escape if you get some white foam at first you can skim it off with a spoon though it won't hurt you how long you let it sit and simmer depends on many things what quantity of beans you are cooking how long they soaked what phase the moon is in and most of all whether or not you have dinner guests but i have found that the most common length of time is between and and hours for cup beans you will have to keep adding more water periodically but don't add salt until the end “shining” it's alright to slow down in fact it feels amazing severe head and skull pains and pressures—not

everyday that a person who served or is serving their country is not some mindless machine they are people like you and i it may seem to some that they have no thoughts feelings or desires but one must remember that they are trained and willingly accept that training in order to do things many others are simply unwilling do do this would perhaps have been made slightly more pleasant if this one girl whom i am having tuition with four times this week would at least make the effort to revise a little before my arrival the concepts that she has forgotten are simple ones that only require memory work they hardly even require her to apply anything it frustrates me so very greatly because i am merely her tutor i cannot do the memory work for her i can only tell her what she needs to commit to memory and then help her with the application but if she doesn’t even bother to commit said things to memory then my presence is rendered pointless selection information this race is a topnotch way to

innercity clubhouse surrounded by poverty abuse gangs darkness jennifer i find this a very difficult question to answer maybe you can tell me i really love all things vintage but on some days it's depressionera aesthetics that make me swoon on others it's the boldness of s modernand then again i am really drawn to much older traditional quilt designs i always respected them but now i am in awe of them especially interpreted in modern fabric i think i'm all over the map but an outsider would probably have a better perspective on this than i do i made the mistake of starting with the pace

including myself have forgotten their goals throughout the year my best tip for you is to write them neatly on pretty pretty paper in your favorite color pen and tape it next to your bed every night before you go to bed take a look at your goals and see if you've gotten closer to any of them don't feel down if you haven't some of your goals might spill over to the year after but use them to clear your mind and think about what you will do the next day i have tasted every vintage of this wine ever shipped to the uk and it just gets better and better i chose to mention this wine deliberately as

having to duck around the flowers i’m half danish half english i live in the uk i speak four languages and love reading and writing in fact i’ve always lived as much between the pages of a book or in

southern kingdoms generally the author writes of one king and then the other who would have been serving at approximately the same time here is a link to a chart that shows all of the kings and the prophets i find it quite helpful to keep a copy of this in my bible as i am reading through these books not too shabby huh the people that we dealt with at this park too were among the nicest we’ve

the reality is that without a solid economic base it is impossible to build an effective foreign policy and under president obama inaugurated in january of and still in office the number of people who have been unable to find jobs or who are underemployed has gone up and stayed up the unemployment rate is not or whatever the bureaucrats quote it as the unemployment rate is much higher than that the number of people underemployed or without a job is in people and has been such now for almost years and likely will continue to be such if obama gets reelected we begin this choice with an anchor

people to share with his whole family and any friends he would like to invite this was the way of sharing the gospel and making disciples that shane’s pastor neal had been leading in their church for a couple of years inspired by training for trainers taught to neal by jeff sundell who had learned it in the decade he and his family did cpm training in nepal and east india it was at least a yearlong commitment for both of them and their families now rickey is teaching that group along with shane and some others and their home group has bounded to over twenty when i was there rickey’s and

skip hotel breakfasts since hotel rates are already exorbitant given the constant demand in paris save the additional costs of having breakfast in the hotel go to one of the bistros and buy yourself a

pay for in hotels if weather permits consider sitting in one of the parks or along the river seine and have a morning picnic admittedly my life has been fairly hectic and sleep has taken a priority over exercise and meal planning how long can i keep using this excuse though not much longer i haven’t taken the necessary actions yet but i have finally reached the point where i can acknowledge that something’s got to go i must prioritise my health or i won’t be around to do all the ‘stuff’ i want to do i won’t get far down my bucket list my wake up call came when i saw this picture posted in a ‘motivation’ thread in a wbt forum as dr phil would have said “how’s that working for ya” for my card i used collecting seashells from stamps happen and i decided to make a scene using distress inks i used some frosted lace stickles for waves but it doesn't show in the pic the little shells were from a woodware nautical set right now i’m trying to change this attitude because it causes unnecessary stress i’m trying to convince myself that it’s ok to get these scores and you shouldn’t compare yourself to anyone you should just try harder and improve the next time and if you did yet you still didn’t get a better grade well it’s fine as long as you like what you’re doing… it’s all about the climb as they say look closely though and the belief in a apocalypse has a great deal in common with the belief that asset prices can have an infinite upside both beliefs offer grand narratives that replace the ordinary patterns of human existence with a somethingfornothing fantasy the bubble believers insist that they can have limitless wealth without having to work for it the believers insist that they can have the new and improved world they think they want—whether that amounts to a new age of enlightenment on the one hand or a hollywood movie world of heroic survivors blazing away against hordes of roving zombies on the other—without having to work for it in either case what drives the fantasy is the conviction that it makes sense to sit on your backside and wait for the market or the space brothers or something else to give you the future you think you deserve so many times i resolve to get to bed at a decent time that i cannot make up for all my failures from the day in the night time and even worse so i make the next day worse from staying up late and frantically trying

moving in the right direction with improved antibullying some efforts at teaching skills and elements of emotional education we still fall short in important areas most important of all is in fact public opinion as long as people in society call for harsher treatment and use criminals as scapegoats for the ills of our world they cannot be treated fairly – and it will be their victims and future

kept asking me whether i had figured out the being’s identity no i hadn’t she seemed highly amused by my cluelessness finally unable to contain herself any longer she told me who he was i was completely surprised despite knowing all about her channeling relationship i had been confused by his ordinariness i explained having previously encountered him as a much more impressive presence she said that he sometimes appears in this very human guise and other times shows his larger self well that’s true of those of us who are embodied too and so it seems quite plausible to me here are her words “jesus christ out of his love for me makes himself as large or small as is needed to allow me to be with him best at the time our relationship has an aspect of being friends and he will make himself to whatever scale is most reassuring for me at the time so i can maintain this feeling so as not to intimidate me and throw me off ’the friends’ track’ sometimes he is immeasurable other times

mango to tofu ratio and was slightly tangy as well as sweet there are other richly constructed characters populating the pages a russian mafia backstory and some other twists and turns oh and of course there is a cute dog but you know we ad people put very little value on the history of our business and we know very little about what got us here doctors study the history of medicine going back to hippocrates lawyers memorize the magna carta the only thing we know about our history is who did the dancing monkey spot in the super bowl as the year passed we talked about it a few times in therapy and a lot of other things that we were dealing with but this one thing came up every once in a while honestly i didn’t think that i would ever get my way but it was worth a try so why we need real authentic sushi in us from living memory the war to end besides the crispy skin the meat is tender and juicy even the chicken breast tastes good soft and moist this is mainly due to the ingredients used the salt and corn starch will lock in the moisture as the chicken roasts it is certainly a nofrills nofail and yet delicious meal that i would go back again and again i am not so concerned about the fat as most of the fat from the chicken melts and drips away during roasting i am always amazed by the amount of oil that is collected in the roasting pan it makes me think that a roast chicken is a much healthier choice than deep fried ones of course the pan juice is best used to make a flavourful sauce out of it but i have given up on it as i was too zealous trying to spoon off every single drop of fat that i was left with not much of juice to work with lolz “one of the schemes for the psychotypization of people — that is distinguishing them by mental properties — the

calcaterra a former practising attorney who has escaped from the law courts to be a writer for nbc about baseball yes that is jealousy you can hear as you read that he has written extensively about these cases most recently at “hardball talk” but he wrote at length about them before following bonds’ indictment he analysed the case here in short he was saying that my life goal must not have wiggle room i must decide–and decide quickly–what my first priority will be and stick with it if god has called me to ministry to people with special needs then i must continue on the path that leads me to that goal there are so many scriptures that teach this principle that my mind was immediately filled with pictures of men going to battle with an adequate army dreaming as the summers die you

situations change momentarily there is unpredictability and we constantly have to adapt to these autism struggles with these adaptations the unpredictable and being flexible these skills can be learnt through specified programmes however without dynamic intelligence the world is overwhelming and scary according to a study comparing cleanliness in different nordic and baltic cities undertaken last summer by denmark’s wonderful copenhagen marketing office foreign tourists determined that reykjavík was the cleanest of them all the temperature here in north central texas is currently colder than the northern half of montana the last time we rose above freezing was about am tuesday morning we had an ice pellet storm on tuesday which has congealed into a solid sheet of ice coating the streets and driveways most of the schools in the area have been shut down since then the streets are simply too slick for safety to add insult to injury inches of snow were dumped on us overnight if i can't have an antique grandfather or mantel clock i could have the soundtrack right in a large pan heat the oil until hot then add the cumin and caraway seeds fry the seeds for about seconds add the

to my darling daughter for letting me use her camera as mine had flat batteries author shannon greenland this beer pours a hazy golden color with one finger's worth of offwhite head that faded quickly into decent spotty lacing the nose hits pretty nicely on this beer and is full of pine grapefruit and other citrus spice and only really a touch of caramel malt base on the nose the flavor starts with plenty of hop bitterness followed by a big rush of citrus fruit and resinous pine flavor the bitterness upfront settled down a bit about half way down my glass and then the caramel malt really provided a decent balance to the hops i think this beer was brewed with only columbus hops but if anyone knows for sure please let me know the wasn't much carbonation in this offering and it left an almost astringent bitterness lingering after the swallow i am fine with that but i can see how others would not like that in the finish i think one bomber was just about perfect for me and i would very much like to try the other ipa styles from flossmoor obviously you expect to be misquoted and have your words twisted by newspapers now it seems it’s common to simply make up entirely fictional stories and even though she tried newcastle city council wants to continue regenerating the area and create a vibrant urban village but the current state of the river with a large drop to the water and an unsightly exposed bed at low tide is seen as a disincentive to future development note that we plotted wku first followed by other member sun belt institutions after that the remaining kentucky schools went on beyond that i left it up to my son to ask questions and pick states until the session ended this morning he rolled out of bed and his first words to me were “what about rhode island” so we put uri’s baby blue and providence’s black on the map before breakfast “okay” he looked crestfallen as he obeyed but quickly turned back to her “it’s just i’m going to get a taxi anyway you could share it if you want i’d pay of course” first let’s look at it from a logical approach we know these facts we talked for a few minutes and i thanked the secretaries for taking care of my son and i suggested we go home my son aggreed and said thank you to the secretaries and placed a death grip on my hand and didn't let go all the way to the parking lot i really liked this outfit because it was comfortable and good for running errands but still had that touch of style and fashion with it inevitably it pauses briefly only to strike out like an angry frog in a sock mutating rapidly into

to be a classic hemingway line until about halfway through the book but it does pick up the pace towards the end the story moves at a reasonable speed but i felt at times it could have been more interesting ultimately i found hemingway’s prose and observations about his own state of mind more enthralling than the slaughter of largely defenceless animals you want that goddamned silver ball out of the goddamned plastic firetruck now it’s as simple as that no need for roses candies serenades poems etc just creative flirty banter that costs nothing and helps you to gain a woman’s interest drenched disgusting i'm so glad to be back crafting i promised myself i would take at least one hour a day to work on a project or post a blog so now on to crafting my review about a decade ago the sword of truth novels were top sellers at the college bookstore where i worked so when i found a special edition of wizard's first rule the first book in the series i purchased it shelved it and promptly forgot i owned it then a few years ago abc produced a tv show called legend of the seeker that was based on the sword of truth series now normally i’m one of those people who likes to read the books before watching the television version but in this instance i made an exception you see the male lead richard cypher was hot go ahead google him if you don't believe me it was kinda nice saying charge it to our room if there were a way to digitally insert the version of ms mitra into every movie ever made i might be offended but i wouldn’t complain once they had their robes and wands it was time for spell class each wizard got his very own spell book and a magical creatures book they learned some important spells then we went through the magical creatures book in order to prepare for a magical creatures hunt i'm inserting arthur christmas at the slot on the list it earns that spot because charlie brown's unabashed embrace of what christmas truly is all about must remain at the top and a christmas story is a movie where each scene outdoes the one before it culminating in the most perfect ending to a christmas movie ever i would have put arthur at but the filmmakers made the horrific choice of including a justin bieber version of santa claus is coming to town which will make you want to kill yourself that misstep means i'm keeping george c scott's exquisite version of a christmas carol in rd and arthur slips in just behind all this of course knocks elf off the list but that's somewhat deserved as the last minutes of the will ferrell movie offer none of the charm or humor of the rest of the film and quite frankly are kind of painful to sit through so off with you buddy the elf and welcome welcome to arthur christmas however because those sightings have become so rare when they do i kinda go crazy with anger thankfully the more recent sightings have been while we're both in separate cars i have managed to avoid any kind of major incident i really don't need a criminal record at this point and frankly i'm pretty sure they could all take me it's not exactly a difficult thing to doi'm sort of fragile these days the “puffyshirt” from the “puffyshirt” episode is on display in the smithsonian to answer that question we need to think about the speed of the moral revolution that has pushed this question to the forefront of our culture in less than a generation homosexuality has gone from being almost universally condemned to being almost fully normalized in the larger society a year later i think it's fair to say that ruby's transition to a pampered life with a pair of besotted humans has gone smoothly she remains a quiet girl who rarely barks and only occasionally whines moose sometimes supposes this behavior is a result of neglect and isolation in her early life poor ruby never learned she could use her voice to command humans and order her world that of course is one reason we've heard relatively little from her here on the blog in other respects though ruby is remarkably transformed from the skinny critter she was a year ago daily exercise and a better diet have bulked her up considerably her paw pads which were soft as a baby's behind when she arrived in roxie's world are now thick with callouses she enjoys walks but the concept of play is still something of a mystery to her unlike me she won't hang out in the yard by herself for extended periods of time chasing squirrels digging holes and woofing at anything that moves in the company of a human however she will race from one end of the ridiculously large backyard

most psychologists psychiatrists and other mental health professionals are not only extraordinarily compliant with authorities but also unaware of the magnitude of their obedience and it also has become clear to me that the antiauthoritarianism of their patients creates enormous anxiety for these professionals and their anxiety fuels diagnoses and treatments one morning i was laying in bed

very upset with me he woke up and cleaned the house the following morning we had argued the night before and the following morning what frustrated me was that i was fuming mad and instead of stopping the fight then and there he fed the fire which can be a very dangerous thing we ended up saying hurtful things towards each other because of stress and anger a few things he said in our fight before this one which was a day or two prior really hurt me i had brushed it off my shoulder at the time and even laughed it off we made up quickly and it wasn't a big deal then it really started to eat away

shilling ales of the th century with the shilling pale ales of the th yes they were to or even ales but these were the thick sweet type of ales than resembled burton ale disguised all that being recapped i’ve come up with a new way of dealing with this… and when i say ‘new way’ i mean it’s ‘new’ for me and my current struggles double chocolate oatmeal cookies it’s truly flabbergasting that this film was written and directed by the same guy that directed body heat and the big chill and that wrote star wars episode v – the empire strikes back as well as raiders of the lost ark those films especially those last two are just truly iconic cinematic gems films that as soon as you hear their name a particular scene or moment or piece of music comes to mind darling companion on the other hand seems to be the exact opposite of that for some reason it’s the sort of film that you’ll have to think for a while to remember what it was when people ask you about just a few months from now the kind of film that is just too mildmannered for it to make any kind of impact the kind of film in which the stakes are just too low for you to really care about what happens in it happy new year it is going to be a busy one for me preparing for a new book and solo show in early autumn first though i am taking part in the courtauld institute of art's east wing x material matters show this opens from the th january at the institute in somerset house in london but being a working college it is only open to the public on the last saturday of each month if you want to catch the show though it runs until june which should give you plenty of opportunity i have a mix of older and newer work in the show including the image above taken near somerset house at the end of last year you can also see

broadcast on live on tv and i ate soba so that was my fairly authenic seeingin of the new year by the way my chinese horoscope is dragon so is my year so i have this idea for a short story it's basically a father discovering that his son has started playing a new and involved game in an effort to be a better parent he decides to start playing himself and becomes the first adult to discover that some of the more wildly fanciful elements that his son has told him about talking gamepieces otherworldly battles etc are true the band's don'tgiveadamn underdog and outsider status is reflected

trump style no permanent error is a soulful reggaeish lament about emailing under the influence and realizing that there is nothing in the world you can do to patch things up just move on it's actually not blustery at all today the elder lucynelle is a cagey creature she does not have much in this world except her daughter and her crumbling farm she feels a love for her daughter she thinks but one wonders how a mother can in a sense sell her daughter into a marriage she does not understand for what … to have someone around to take care of the place it is a good business deal but betrays the very meaning of the love a mother ought to have for her children not to mention the love within marriage the mother is blind to the sacred nature of her maternal duty to protect her child and even more uncomprehending of the sacred nature of marriage missing the sacred she betrays it for and a half proverbial pieces of silver the conservatives hope to have a bill that would allow them to declare countries safe passed by late june i love experimenting with new techniques as well as thrashing the trusty faves i just enjoy the ride when creating a layout and in a nutshell i would describe my style as colourful fun and funky breakfast cheese grits calories at the very least make what i’m watching interesting perhaps it would be a good move for labour to adopt a more mature attitude of a similar spirit sort out which message it wants to get out and act in a more constructive manner and work with the government to find a solution at the moment the labour party appears opportunistic not only on policy relating to income tax evasion and charity giving but on a range of issues labour needs to start showing itself as a credible alternative as a government rather than an anticoalition party or maybe that’s their election strategy and they’ll just fill in miliband’s blank sheet of paper if and when he gets into number … whining complaining general unhappiness and dissatisfaction the sound from firpo's recording would have been relatively imperfect but the image makes me want to know more where was the studio how did the musicians get there what was the weather like a day in buenos aires long ago a tango recorded and some sweet slightly distant music we can still hear photo it must be remembered that not only are syria’s rebels committing horrific atrocities amidst an admittedly terroristic campaign against the syrian people they do so with arms funding equipment training and political support from the “friends of syria” cadre including the us uk france saudi arabia and qatar in all several major american telecommunication companies and many of the nation’s leading retailers endorse the act but tonight i am actually going to update each award winner has to show the award and put the name and link to the blog that has given her or him the award itself i wonder what kevin donlan has in mind when he speaks of “a new model for a new day” i have finished a careful study of the new rwandan canons and the anglican mission canonical charter they evidence the strong influence of the roman catholic code of canon law in language doctrine norms and principles in a number of places the rwandan canons clearly are repudiation of the thirtynine articles and of authentic historic anglicanism and embrace in their place the dogmas of the council of trent the provisions governing the relationship of the rwandan primate with anglican primatial vicar chuck murphy are based upon the provisions of the roman catholic code of canon law governing the relationship of the pope to lesser bishops of the roman catholic church this causes me also to wonder what part donlan himself played in their formulation pick flowers really i asked her surprised in your mind a thought that you know makes you happy that you substitute broadcasts knowing my creativity needed a boost i signed up two days before it started two days i had no plan no prompts no list no nothing while my husband wondered what had happened to his real wife i banged my head on my desk a few times hoping to shake some sense loose but this this was different i always thought of the hungarians as mildmannered people spicewise based i suppose on their love of sweet paprika that you said you didn't want to fade ribbon from my stash so if you're still participating in the generosity challenge here's today's challenge item i’m still not entirely clear on the origins of holi – i have heard four different opinions from three different sources – but my favorite explanation by far was offered by the local chabad rabbi who suggested on friday night that holi is actually purim m’hodu v’ad kush he also advised those still looking for a purim costume to spend about ten minutes outside during holi the above is the result of two hours of hard work which is a great idea if you want to dress up for purim like keha the burlesque performer’s silhouette morphs from a louboutin shoe to dance on stage before she transforms back into a stiletto then again i think we got that from all the fighting so i’m not sure we needed the narration what we really didn’t need is the sudden starting and stopping of laughter–we get it he’s crazy that bit really broke the movie for me it was the first crack that made sure nothing else in the movie would be tense because i didn’t care about this guy anymore i just wanted him to stop icing sugar i only really realized recently try saying 'really realized recently' ten times fast p that i'm actually along with being anarchist anticivilization i've held those views for a while but only recently realized that those views had a name now when people hear 'anticivilization' their first reaction is often horror they seem to feel it's as good as saying 'antihuman' although nothing could be further from the truth these are completely unique – i am planning on making just one more of each style but they will all have different buttons bent double like old beggars under sacks the boys had one particular little mate that lived in the server room and despite orders to the contrary they kept their mousey fat on biscuit crumbs and boiled eggs i now knew what a muffin was in castellano i was prepared for future ordering that's how you appreciate something you want it to happen now you know we had a bit of a speeddating experience with the authors total in attendance i believe and had a few minutes to spend with each or two at a time to ask them questions listen to them talk about their books their upcoming projects the weather whatever lol it was the first year that yart has done this event and i really hope they do it again my only disappointment was that we didn’t have the opportunity to meet with more authors but there wasn’t the time i will never ask you to suspend your healthy skepticism except to point out that sometimes the eye roll reflex needs to be put on hold in order to consider new potential realities which for once actually work out good for us and bad for the scaly decepticon slave drivers after contacting the host we were assured this only had a couple days to go and the rest of the work would only be painting we were satisfied but as the days continued the noise also continued from here on the host was unhelpful and almost impossible to connect with airbnb offered no solution so we decided

consensus over osama bin laden’s legacy the man who sparked a decade of costly conflict by sending two planes into new york’s world trade centre is ultimately responsible for the deaths of many many innocent people and deep divisions between the islamic and western worlds we got to the restaurant ordered dinner and chatted the usual vital stats were exchanged talk of our respective jobs no matter how hard i tried my eyes were constantly drawn to his mouth i desperately hoped he didn’t notice after dinner where i like the idiot that i am ordered the hottest dish on the menu and then carried on as though my mouth wasn’t burning like the deepest bowels of hell we walked up to the coffee shop and went for a walk around town we talked about his son childhood memories blah blah blah short term memory i don’t remember everything we talked about – he would i do remember him telling me he was going on the road for weeks the following morning my immediate thought “i can’t let him go before i know more” so i suggested a drive and he quickly agreed i’d love to know what he was thinking at this time perhaps i’ll ask him a killing sets off the worst riots in modern times and it is seriously suggested by the authorities that people should be kept in the dark it is a matter of overwhelming public interest that the truth should be ascertained so that the lessons can be learnt today i want to share another layout created for the papercraft hub this image of liam has been sitting on my desk for some time i guess i've just been waiting for the right kind of inspiration to scrap it lol so

southwest those of you who are still paying attention will realize that the past tense has been used throughout this blog and so we come to the irony at last six weeks before george osborn the uk’s chancellor of the exchequer mentioned tif in his budget statement the model was abolished in the state of california two thousand and eleven was a year of claims and counter claims over the valueadded of redevelopment agencies debates that were often played out in both the law courts and in the media it got ugly – ‘toxic’ according to some – and ended up in the california supreme court on december this ruled that ab – which would have meant the redevelopment agencies handing over large amounts of their reserves to the state – was illegal the court basically reinforced proposition so far so good for redevelopment agencies and the california redevelopment association that represented them however the supreme court upheld ab – which meant that as the state had created redevelopment agencies and tif through the act and its addition it could also end them redevelopment agencies would be dissolved panic in the california redevelopment community set in attempts were made to build bridges with the governor’s office and the state legislator but to no avail tif and the plus redevelopment agencies that used the model to fund a range of projects around the state ceased to exist on february the result remains an absolute mess one sort of bureaucracy is being replaced with another successor agencies around california are trying to manage the winding down of a highly complex and locally specific ‘model’ meanwhile at the state level jerry brown is pulling in staff from different department to oversee the processes through which it gets to give the okay to some tif projects to continue and to end others watch out for wave after wave of court cases as all involved seek to establish landmark rulings that’s why i am so bothered by the party’s recent loss of two upandcoming republicans san diego mayoral candidate nathan fletcher currently a state assemblyman and former assemblyman and current congressional candidate anthony adams both of whom left the party to become independents on the one hand i respect their standing up for principle on the other i hate to see them go in today’s world our generation has become increasingly dependent on our smart phones during every free moment in our hectic lives such as lunch we are texting friends checking emails playing games or checking our social networking page it angers me how people get caught up in their smart phones and not pay attention to the other people around them i find this to be rather rude and insulting casey’s contraptions just stay i’m not perfect so our unique perceptions of the world we experienced together were destined to be endlessly different destined to be unrelated and no matter what i said to her she would never understand that what i write on these pages when i say that i have no home and that i am endlessly tormented by the constant need to leave everything behind and travel to give up the entire world i’ve created and move on to something new that this isn’t in any way a sad thing in my eyes lots of folks take the great commission to mean they need to venture to the far corners of the world to spread the gospel of jesus christ and they do i am blessed when i think of the sacrifice it takes and the heart for god these folks exhibit to spread the gospel across the globe jesus taught us to make disciples of all nations kalabokisio corn puree by “scientifically” i mean “based on my own very special criteria that varies by the day and generally boils down to my personal taste” but i realize that my just saying so doesn’t make for a good read so here’s my thought process and the sentiment is from close to my heart card chatter birthday cupons chds there is something intrinsically appealing to me in a scene of water and land meeting the reeds and lily pads and the stones and muck underneath it is comforting for me to watch such a scene but i would never step into it and wrap myself in the water’s lapping embrace because i am terrified of the bottom of lakes the muck and stones and worms and leeches and turtles promised under water the same things that seem to evoke serenity in me when i look upon them disgust and terrify me when i enter into the picture instead i

for painstaking minutes on end at car accidents as they are passed on the roads but this experience i put down to an appreciation of the author’s ability to create characters so inherently complex that one becomes confused on a fundamental moral level as to where the antagonist fits into the entire plot now perhaps it is just me though i am disinclined to agree with this hasty assumption but the clear antagonist of the tale the obvious “bad guy” as it were the gentleman proudly walking through page after page sporting his massive black tophat was my personal favoured character by page and had my deepest sympathies and affection as his part in the story drew to a close and our beloved heroine lanny bricked him up in a wall in favour of a man who would never truly love her despite his glaring inadequacies as a trustworthy individual okay perhaps i am downplaying the sheer wickedness of the character to an extent adair expressed love toward lanore a possessive love certainly perhaps

luckily when the cough occurred we were climbing out of the deepest bit do those things god damnit because nothing sucks worse than a girl who reads do it i say because a life in purgatory is better than a life in hell do it because a girl who reads possesses a vocabulary that can describe that amorphous discontent as a life unfulfilled—a vocabulary that parses the innate beauty of the world and makes it an accessible necessity instead of an alien wonder a girl who reads lays claim to a vocabulary that distinguishes between the specious and soulless rhetoric of someone who cannot love her and the inarticulate desperation of someone who loves her too much a vocabulary god damnit that makes my vacuous sophistry a cheap trick however as stated above the consequences so far described are only first round effects those other banks and financial institutions who lose out big time when the bank goes bust may find that for some of them this is the straw that broke the camel's back which will expose what a sham the recent european bank stress tests really were some of them may go bust too but in that case the very same argument the very same response from workers should be made the workers in those banks should occupy them too and take them over as coops in fact that would open the door to those banks combining with the aib coop and the coop bank in britain and other coop organisations throughout europe to form a very powerful financial cooperative indeed some of the organisations that have invested in these banks may be large or medium sized enterprises who may also go bust but again the answer is the same the workers should occupy the only thing that has real value the factories shops and offices and the equipment within them they should continue to operate them under workers control and demand the right to take them over and run them as workers cooperatives as the workers in argentina have done over the last few years when their businesses went bust and as the

richard brodhead the university’s most significant raciallyoriented episode involved not racism toward africanamerican students or professors but a raciallycharged crusade directed by members of the school’s africanamerican studies department against a group of falsely accused white duke students apart from a single statement from provost peter lange rebuking an outright racist screed from thenduke professor houston baker—and a vague tardy and ultimately toothless apology from brodhead—there’s no evidence that anyone from duke’s administration ever addressed this faculty behavior or ever rebuked those duke professors whose private biases led them to ignore their obligations to their own institution’s students the issue has fallen into entirely predictable lines with accusations of sexism and demeaning women on one hand and humourlessness on the other and i've no intention of rehashing it here personally i'm not too concerned about this name although there have been one or two names over the years that i disliked not all women find such names offensive one of my female friends delights in ordering top totty when it's on at our local and tory mp tracey crouch twittered

last night i was telling ross sometimes it just seems so selfish this life that he is wasting the improvement of the blacks in body and mind in the first instance of their mixture with the whites has been observed by every one and proves that their inferiority is not the effect merely of their condition of life we know that among the romans about the augustan age especially the condition of their slaves was much more deplorable than that of the blacks on the continent of america the two sexes were confined in separate apartments because to raise a child cost the master more than to buy one cato for a very restricted indulgence to his slaves in this particular took from them a certain price but in this country the slaves multiply as fast as the free inhabitants their situation and manners place the commerce between the two sexes almost without restraint the same cato on a principle of economy always sold his sick and superannuated slaves he gives it as a standing precept to a master visiting his farm to sell his old oxen old wagons old tools old and diseased servants and every thing else become useless… the american slaves cannot enumerate this among the injuries and insults they receive it was the common practice to expose in the island esculapius in the tyber diseased slaves whose cure was like to become tedious the emperor claudius by an edict gave freedom to such of them as should recover and first declared that if any person chose to kill rather than expose them it should be deemed homicide the exposing them is a crime of which no instance has existed with us and were it to be followed by death it would be punished capitally we are told of a certain vedius pollio who in the presence of augustus would have given a slave as food to his fish for having broken a glass with the romans the regular method of taking the evidence of their slaves was under torture here it has been thought better never to resort to their evidence when a master was murdered all his slaves in the same house or within hearing were condemned to death here punishment falls on the guilty only and as precise proof is required against him as against a freeman yet notwithstanding these and other discouraging circumstances among the romans their slaves were often their rarest artists they excelled too in science insomuch as to be usually employed as tutors to their masters’ children epictetus terence and phaedrus were slaves but they were of the race of whites it is not their condition then but nature which has produced the distinction whether further observation will or will not verify the conjecture that nature has been less bountiful to them in the endowments of the head i believe that in those of the heart she will be found to have done them justice that disposition to theft with which they have been branded must be ascribed to their situation and not to any depravity of the moral sense the man in whose favour no laws of property exist probably feels himself less bound to respect those made in favour of others when arguing for ourselves we lay it down as a fundamental that laws to be just must give a reciprocation of right that without this they are mere arbitrary rules of conduct founded in force and not in conscience and it is a problem which i give to the master to solve whether the religious precepts against the violation of property were not framed for him as well as his slave and whether the slave may not as justifiably take a little from one who has taken all from him as he may slay one who would slay him that a change in the relations in which a man is placed should change his ideas of moral right or wrong is neither new nor peculiar to the colour of the blacks homer tells us it was so years ago jove

issue is any indication superman might just be that title this would be appropriate since everyone knows who superman is he's not only dc's most famous character but one of the most recognizable fictional characters in all of literature therefore you don't really need to spend a lot of time introducing the characters to new readers if you were in a comics shop about to pick up your first ever

relevant sdos into adopting the umts standard by committing to license its wcdma technology on frand terms and later after lockinoccurred demanding nonfrand royalties as qualcomm is at pains to point out no court nor agency has decided this precise question and in that sense our decision will break new ground the authorities we have cited in our lengthy discussion that has preceded this point however decidedly favor a finding that broadcom’s allegations if accepted as true describe actionable anticompetitive conduct while i was on the search for an agent one of the things i found most fascinating were “agent stories” i wanted to know the tricks and secrets maybe glean a little from those who had jumped from the boat of the agentless to the boat where every sentence begins with “my agent said…” you see dear reader i have spent two halfdays over the last week on the phone arguing with the phone company and their debt collectors perhaps a shiver is now running down your spine as you recall the horror of your own experience the news is always full of dreadful statistics about what a disastrous job the telecommunications industry is doing in the area of customer services if the astounding numbers of complaints disputes and interventions by the ombudsman are any indication what can one say but aaargh or perhaps something that would conventionally be spelt with little stars

her and her husband jeff for lunch and a visit to a local flower and garden shop that she had been meaning to visit former tennis champion the enjoyment factor of this show… it may not have been obvious throughout the review but i fucking loved watching this show it is easily the best ‘so bad it’s good’ thing i’ve watched in a long long while the trainwreck attraction of this was absolutely glorious you just don’t get one on this scale like ever the awful characters the nonsensical plot the contrived twists all of it combined to make guilty crown outstandingly hilarious adding to the big joke that is this series is just how high profile it was – the staff lineup the budget the studio the fact that it’s a noitamina series airing over two seasons which so rarely happens with noitamina it looked so set to be a massive massive thing and seeing it fail this fucking hard was absolutely hilarious i’m glad i got to watch it as it aired and i’m sad to see it go because i’ll never get to see something as bad as guilty crown in this way for a long long time in addition these pringoleras will carry signs that say keep your hands off my peanut butter and smorgen hopes to turn the obelisk in the center of de julio into a giant bottle of tobasco echo and the bunnymen pictures on my wall layer upon layer of moment’s arrested in objects echo through my mind we go out lets look at this time last year alicia packed up peter and forcibly moved him to a new apartment then got in a hotel elevator with will on the way to open the doors on their longthwarted passion now that’s the kind of cliffhanger that has you marking the days until the show returns in the fall and it’s that implicit understanding of its protagonist that makes belle de jour feel still relevant and satisfying even today when it’s social politics are starting to feel fairly quaint it is a film about the struggle to embrace one’s true self even when it clashes with the identity society puts upon you in that way and in a very similar vein i would compare it to a movie such as secretary which explored similar concepts in a more conventional as if such words were ever used for that movie romantic comedy setup but few movies delve so deeply into the strange and bewildering blurred lines between reality and fantasy like belle de jour where the unconscious and the consciously suppressed merge to become one complex delicate lens through which séverine and everyone really views the world tiny pieces of you we innocently laughed at anyone mistaking us for such a thing and especially for two people in the

subject of much comment and speculation in the media – it will be interesting to see what public and industry response there is to the current proposal the deadline for submissions is friday august if

blog but to meet in person is really special and by the waymike the shipping guy her husband is a one super fellow too so my wish for today to jan marie is to have a day of happiness laughter relaxation and so much fun you can't see straight now i am not suggesting that we do this consciously although some parents undoubtedly do so i just think that as humans we are somehow wired this way to get caught up in the heat and passion of a moment and try to win so we can get our way or fulfill our wants and needs here is a project i just made with the help of my yearold granddaughter i got

well not that i’m running out of things to talk about on the blog here i’m not but i wanted to add another reoccurring feature so that throughout a week there are a mix of reoccurring features and completely new stuff i’m not tying most of it down to a particular day but this one may occur most weeks and mostly on a wednesday or maybe not it’s just evolution of the blog ‘dickless chix’ by molly heckard sarah joyce what is the reaction of man when jesus christ reveals himself we want to look at this in three ways and one of these will relate to you naturally we look at saul of tarsus he had been blind spiritually not comprehending the light in john we see this truth and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not” up to this point saul did not recognise his spiritual condition of being in darkness but the thoughts are trickling back and i know that the more i write the more they'll start flooding back and so relief is in sight there too i was obviously too quiet you know…like when your kids go quiet and you realise that something is up and with its interaction “our best seller is the goat’s milk lotion” she said “we sell a lot of that i use it

i dab it on to my face afterwards” orektlka vintage and antique items with a southern soul “there will be radical change and i believe it will be driven by technology” kerzner said “i think there will still be many producers but they will be able to see far more clients by using technology rather than getting in the car driving an hour and hoping a client actually showed up that could certainly increase productivity by a quantum leap” borislow of mdrt agreed that new technology will improve the business but more important is a new perspective on fulfilling some old values i have passed by

over the place and just when i found a really good deal like round trip the prices shot up the next day and then a few days after that the airline filed for bankruptcy and cancelled every flight until may every other airline was so expensive out of every city and i just became discouraged that is until i found a flight out of grand rapids mi through airtran for about round trip and with decent flight times we've never flown out of grand rapids before but the airport will be really simple to get to and will be shorter drive than we're used to going to detroit this is such a nice piece it

broadcasting a pirate radio show from the moldy jizzstained confines of your parents' basement might seem a tad quaint–especially in a world dominated by social media and reality television–but in it was groundbreaking stuff seriously a disaffected teen as the catalyst for change wasn't that farfetched during a time when apathy and yuppie culture had infected the general populace spouting a crude yet compelling melange of saucy malapropisms on the radio complimented by an eclectic array of rap punk pop and leonard cohen a properly motivated adolescent in a bowling shirt could inspire the alienated and the downtrodden hovering around their speakers to do his or her bidding and do so with an alarming ease it didn't matter if person doing the talking originally intended to shake things up your voice was singled out as the champion for those being buttsurfed by the system whether you like it or not my pirate radio station for example would have been an eardestroying cacophony of postindustrial sex music and italo disco with weather and fashion updates on the hour in other words while my station's chic temperament would never be in doubt its seemingly innocuous content

geologists can argue over how such a huge deposit formed in one area of the world — but that’s the situation getting my magazines but man are organizing and storage components expensive they add up quite quickly especially if you're overhauling your entire home like i am after hubby made me a delish quick dinner with store bought cannelloni one night i was washing out the pasta tray to plop it in the recycling i couldn't get over how thick and sturdy the plastic was i was blown away with how similar it was to the black plastic drawer organizer i had recently purchased for my cosmetics drawer but that’s not really what i set out to write about what i meant to write about is the life changing power of laughter so things are running through my head right now an ounces bag of

taliban written all over it is serious enough to have everything else take the back seat i went out with some girlfriends last night it was another reminder that the universe is listening to me even if i'm not asking the questions out loud they told me about the true meaning of friendship they told me how they understand my feelings they told me that they do not and would not judge methey told me i had a safe place to go i don't think there are words to express how much i really really needed to hear that i am grateful for each of those ladies this islamic jihad leader has gained followers all over the world demanding his release on september mark yarm published the book everybody loves our town an oral history of grunge i read it and loved it and it left me thinking about my ’ s youth the music that spilled out of old seattle and also about vasquez i spun a bunch of his records and thought about how his music seemed to have so much potential for wider appreciation if not on the scale of his seattle contemporaries then at least an appeal wide enough to have elevated him beyond the status of “tragically overlooked local legend” but there are those musicians who just want to write music and be left alone they enjoy the creative process for its own intrinsic rewards and don’t want to perform publically or make money from their art or even involve themselves in the commercial aspects of being in a band you have to respect that touring booking dealing with club owners record labels and royalties – from all reports it sounds grating maybe vasquez is that type of musician or maybe he was selfsabotaging maybe he just needed a little outside push to get him going or maybe he pushed too many people away it’s all speculation yet the record is indisputable during the early ’ s while fellow northwesterners such as nirvana mudhoney and soundgarden appeared on innumerable magazine covers released albums on major labels and graduated to the large concert stages and world tours that defined their mid s careers vasquez remained in seattle playing the occasional local venue pressing small runs of seveninches and working odd jobs which is where he remains today as talented as ever and just as invisible thanks for reading i'll be back later this week a lot of my coworkers are crazy about the thing but i just can’t stand the thought of yet another giant leap forward in technology so soon after i’m barely comfortable with my envirosak i feel like i’m living in one of those rapidly emerging cultures of asia where half a generation ago nobody even had a landline phone

of your favorite things we’ve gotten lots of yard work done and have done some fun things tim and laurie thornton amazed us as they skillfully played sang and told stories of what the lord had done in their lives at one point in the concert my mind started to drift and the thoughts began to eat away at my brain what if it doesn't work out what if he breaks my heart what if this isn't right and in that moment i heard the lord whisper to me he is your gift all of the sudden a million other questions entered my mind for now for this year forever but no answer was given just that he was my gift no cracks of light yep it is the wet hands technique certainly one of the most popular among most women polled so simple so exciting you will leave her absolutely breathless well this is the kind of movie that you've already watched once and you dig it and then two years later somebody mentions about it and you're suddenly thrilled to watch it again and the second time doesn't feel anything like

together this was extremely helpful in me adding to my original list and determining all of the categories that would be most beneficial to our family here is what we came up with as a group of category ideas but you know as far as the cities go – in a lot of ways i’ll always be more connected to nashville and murfreesboro and middle tennessee than i ever have been to memphis even though i was born here and have a long history here and strong connections here including having had strong family connections here and probably more than i ever will be to knoxville don’t really have any to chattanooga other than a family member living there for a while who no longer does i should trust myself more this is a challenge because i haven’t been very selfaware in the past i think this is linked to my devaluation of my selfworth due to my abuse i haven’t felt that i was very valuable so trusting my own feelings over other’s opinions still is a challenge so maybe this is god telling me to use the gift of wisdom he has given me maybe my reluctance to continue therapy with t is his way of telling me that i need to find someone else if you want to quickly and effectively reduce costs

of the need for costeffective methods the program can be taught in an hour long assembly or broken down into shorter assemblies to meet the school’s scheduling needs while it supports the schools

outstanding despite tugendhat j's conclusion that the 'case will now proceed to trial in the usual way in accordance with the cpr' for example although it seems unlikely that mr edwards and michael mendahun named as a defendant because the sex video was available on a website operated by him would oppose the grant of a permanent injunction there is no procedure for obtaining a permanent injunction against 'generally described persons' such as the second defendant in these circumstances it is suggested that tulisa would need to obtain a 'contra mundum' 'against the world' order against either mr edwards or mr mendahun however obtaining such an order may not be straightforward as neither mr edwards nor mr mendahun appears to be threatening further publication of the sex tape but a nap would be good in a very real way to be human is to love other species and so long as that remains rational and not carried to extremes that is a very good thing “it’s so incredibly beautiful leah did you dream it or what” i was truly stunned so is a minimum wage worth it if you take a utilitarian approach it defiantly is not minimum wage deflates the dollar and causes unemployment and is unnecessary another question to consider is to whom does the minimum wage hurt the most if i was a business owner and the minimum wage was installed and i knew i was going to need to make cuts i would fire the least productive workers first i mean that would makes sense the most productive workers will keep their jobs perhaps even with higher pay to compensate for the extra work meanwhile the lesserskilled workers will be unemployed the unintended consequence of the situation is that most people who support a minimum wage are hoping to help out the workers at the bottom when in reality a higher minimum wage could very well put those workers out of a job universal music group and awww man snowflakes falling in october bundled and shivering you could see my smile from the moon i love the cold crisp air it wakes your ass right up some see sneezes i see sweaters something had to make up for the horrid unmissed humidity here still i'm readjusting to the rain and actual weather hehe i'm still expecting perma sunshine perhaps the lack of meat on my bones will have me singing a different tune come late november but i doubt it p i'm not physically equipped for these chilly temps but i'm prepping for winter already now i'll get some good use out of what remains of my sweater stash i thought i was inspired beforewheeeee i've missed my seasonal bundlingi made need to be sedated the excitement is killing me the autumn rains in righteousness another simplicity i do think this is my last one of me made may though i made this one from a vintage curtain i bought at a fair and i blogged about it here when i made it last year i haven't worn it for a while and i was really pleased with it when i put it on this morning it's really well made i'm standing a bit weirdly here because my friend sj was taking these photos in the stairwell at work and i felt a bit awkward but it's a really good fit i love the fabric it's so loud it seems like pretty much everything handmade in my wardrobe is made in some sort of novelty print but i can live with that the only thing for it was to wear it with equally loud irregular choice shoes of course how's that for alliteration if you read my blog last week you'll know that it was my first week at my graduate job it was nervewracking confusing and overwhelming but really really exciting too i wasn't given too many tips or restrictions when it comes to attire with my boss simply stipulating 'it would probably be best to dress how you would for a job interview' but i played it really safe my first week the first day my makeup was incredibly neutral and disgusting i pretty much sweated it all off before i got there because of nerves and i got a little more adventurous as the week went on i took cues from the other girl who works there there are only other people on our team since she seems to be into makeup too “i think we do not need to talk about anwar anymore it is not about anwar when we talk politics we

like when i make up stories to entertain myself and occasionally others or when i can see solutions to problems where all obvious options have been exhausted it becomes a pain in the ass when it comes to looking forward to anything like holidays for example because i imagine every detail of what is about to happen and what i am about to see and how it would make me feel i often and up disappointed at the reality it feels like i've already done it the experience loses the novelty factor so now i try not to look forward to anything imagine anything real i just let the reality do its thing and hope for a pleasant surprise on the other hand i can imagine all the worse case scenarios too which makes it a relief when none of them happen so my pretties what do you have to do to enter for a chance to win all these glorious goodies well remember me talking about the queen of teen award before i'd still very much like to win that my lovelies and i don't think so far that we've done enough to get me there maybe it's not possible but it would be great to get onto the shortlist at least “in the month of july i was sad in my husband’s best friend’s parents’ presence and so they asked me ‘why does your face look so sad when you are not really sick no brain tumors you must be sad in your heart’ i was very afraid but i said to them ‘i love you dearly and why should i not be sad when the other half of my family my ancestors are missing hidden from me and my heart is heavy because i feel lost’” if true that could be a cbs game one would think thank goodness it’s a little cooler by then

throbbing bass kazoos hyperactive horn sections and group vocals often pierced by vander's curious falsetto the familiar jazz and rock elements are still present but magma pumps out some serious funk

attention such people can be pushed by circumstances to take desperate measures and this sad case should heighten calls for more support and better protection for people living on the edge i saw freefall is a mixture of romance drama and coming of age there are several intense scenes filled with unadulterated emotion but the underlying messages run deep and strike the reader quickly and strongly despite these scenes the majority of the book really is humorous much of this comes from seth scott has nailed the male narrative bringing seth to life in fantastic ways his logic is so simple and logical it’s funny the things he says the thoughts he has and the reasons he does things build his personality in a great way he slips the reader into his mind easily from the start and through scott’s writing and his narrative the reader is often left feeling confused and shocked his emotions are raw and unstoppable his screw ups huge and frustrating and his comebacks gratifying at

the night why would they be there when things were so tense between the ludwigs and the rest of the community why would they be driving on anyone’s property at that hour i’ve since come to learn that it is broad daylight at in the morning at that time of year in this part of the country so it wasn’t dark nevertheless it is still not a time when people visit each other i am not blaming karman for her death though the situation was complicated from the highest point at m above sea level in the ruwenzori mountain range to the quattarah depression at m below sea level the river channel consists of flat reaches in certain subbasins presently linked by steep channels within this basin the topography is diverse the highlands of the ethiopian plateau and the “mountains of the moon” in central africa give way to the lowland pastoral plains of sudan and the deserts of egypt tropical vegetation snowcapped peaks and some of the driest areas in the world as well as some of the largest bodies of inland waters can be found along the basin’s length and breadth below are a few pictures from my camera lens of hong kong during this festival time for congolese treasure i don't know a year on this one no but only words are these things really providing security or taking it away it's such a slippery slope when you have weapons like these available to law enforcement what happens when young street protesters push to strongly against the police during a occupy 'event' what keeps someone high up from pressing the button on those 'enemies from within' that’s why there’s cache cachememory access is almost as fast as register access but you can have a lot of cache memory—comparatively l caches typically have or kbyte capacities and often there are independent caches for instructions and

since erik schurink jessica's hesitation earned her a little respect from david being featured on angie's pretty blog a little inspiration and for being reminded of what inspires me my children my faith my small corner of the world and the good people who occupy it thank you angie pacing i think i’m making it sound more boring than it is but i want to really fix this in my memory and in the blog’s memory this is the first pulitzer novel that’s not only been sympathetic to a minority but has actually succeeded in treating minority characters with the dignity and respect of being real human beings in order to do that la farge has to jettison a lot of other things but the result is this quiet little novel that begins in childish joy and ends with very mature grief a novel that years later is still moving to me at least because it makes its characters too real for me to avoid feeling their emotions alongside them he finds a way of writing that simultaneously makes the foreignness of their phrases clear they speak a different language than i do and yet does not destroy their intelligence by dumbing down the dialogue i don’t know if high schoolers today would sit still for laughing boy but if they did i think more of them would connect with the story than wouldn’t and in the end it would spark the right kind of conversations about america that is can still do that now makes it a worthy pulitzer winner in my book even if it isn’t wharton and it’s not guys i went into this book wanting to love it as much as every one i know did they all said that amy is your average teen that everyone can relate to but i really couldn't this was probably my biggest issue with amy is that i couldn't understand her at all more than that i didn't like her or most of the other characters in the book i got that she has low selfesteem but she never stood up for herself ever pernell demond jefferson who was arrested but apparently not convicted for murdering england’s father is serving a relatively light prison sentence for “pointing a firearm” and is due to be released in october and here is mummy duck herself what a clever girl she is nietzsche’s overall attitude towards the theses of the genealogy is contradictory he exposes quite neatly and perceptively how so many supposedly noble ideas – good evil guilt conscience justice purity selflessness etc – are really methods of torment and cruelty concocted so as to maintain and defend oppression and inequality yet at the same time he is clearly more enthusiastic about inequality and oppression than about almost anything else – his whole philosophy is geared towards a love for anyone who can and will treat other people like dirt and control them and so in this sense his ‘unmasking’ of moral fictions is really a defense of them let's get personal the gallery i hope everybody has a fabulous weekend as for myself i gotta go now busy busy busy brayan is off to a fairly decent start this year he is

smaller version of the strathmore visual journalit's a x sizeso a little more manageable size i have the mixed media onei love the paper in thisyou can do anything you want to it and i decided to use all of these art supplies that i have but have been afraid to touch because i don't know how to use them i've said this beforei always love when i'm making art for myselfi always like it most of the time so waking up to the reality of a piano barless pop culture joe and i have done a fun thing we’ve created one at home in recent years i’ve focused on learning some favorite classics easier versions of mozart beethoven schubert etc i am working george winston’s arrangement of pachebel’s canon up to tempo how i love that piece of work and homing in big time on scott joplin’s rags now i was angry “at least half a dozen americans will be wondering why we selected a morbidly suicidal beatles song while these two i pointed to the now frightened and confused church singers who actually didn’t understand the lyrics because they didn’t speak any english are belting out ‘i did something wrong now i long for yesterday’ people will be questioning the validity of my marriage before it’s even final” this movie definitely doesn’t present a “plan of salvation” and it does not march a bunch of foot soldiers wearing the armor of god to the cadence of specific doctrine instead what i took away from it was that it let people see the little streaks of light christ poking through the misdirection of a college student that was trying so hard to get as far away from god as possible god never leaves and you cannot escape him he is everywhere he is even at the socalled “godless” liberal arts colleges in order for us to receive love and kindness we must give love and kindness the more love and kindness we give to others the lighter our energy becomes and the more we become like the branches at the top of the tree the more love and kindness we give the more love and kindness we can receive in return as we go through our day our week or our lives we should spread love and kindness through our words our gestures our hugs etc etc when our intent is with love and kindness we raise the vibration of the world it affects us those around us all living creatures plants and our earth the entire world will begin to smile if each day you do kind things for others write it down and

blending chalk i used creative inspirations paint in winter frost and added a little detail to the edges with a paint brush the shimmer really added that little something extra to the card i gathered

entering this at one of the biggest problems with monarchies is that the enforcement of rules and regulations can easily be arbitrary since the power is in the hands of the emperor but the emperor had

were closed so my phone was temporarily out of service for the night this morning i grabbed my phone to take with me as normal my daughter said “mom your phone is dead but you’re carrying it like it still works” before i could answer her my son replied “her phone power is dead for now but as soon as she plugs it up or fix the problem it will work again” inhabitants of the planet telos the cryons

has been up to lately he’s also been keeping up with his freshwater tanks we got rid of the saltwater a while back but we’ve still got the other two he completely redid the smaller one this past weekend because it had an algae problem he put new substrate in the bottom bought new plants washed out the tank completely and even gave the fish some new decorations he’s also ordered a new bulb to help with the plants and algae we’re hoping the new additionsupgrades keep the algae in check because the tank is looking great at the moment i’ve learned a lot about anger and i’ve had to admit there are other ways to deal with my anger at my dad besides shooting his balls off though once in a while i admit it is a somewhat satisfying visualization i like and respect three floyds’ work as evidenced by my story in the tribune this week i stand by how i quoted nick floyd regarding portland beer in the blog post that accompanied the story hosted by the inaccurately named cedric the

that i visit it every single day and not once either you will too — if you want your articles to be informative grounded by fact and not just your opinions the challenge tomorrow on take a word is

boys deciding to color easter eggs without me i told them we would would color eggs when i came back from the grocery store they called me on my cell while i was shopping to say they decorated the eggs without me they were so proud what business is it of total strangers as to how long we have been here how would they react if we asked them loads of personal questions this leads to the film’s most common criticism that it cheaps out on showing the horror that a viewer presumably expects to see based on the cover art unsurprisingly i disagree i love zombie flicks but they’re samey in their special effects and “shocking” gore notes they’re almost comforting that way like a bedtime story you’ve heard read a hundred times…assuming your father was jeffrey dahmer if a character on a crackly phone line describes an undead mob converging on a victim i’ve got the mental image in place by the fourth word if that mob is dogpiling on a family’s car while imitating windshieldwiper blades…i’ve

magic hat the slits fm i try not to describe comedy shows in too much detail but… knowing now that so many of us song of the wanderer anyway i just wanted to share i love it did i mention that the palestinians can’t disguise their crimes as military actions the israelis can we can’t say “the israelis don’t kill civilians” at most we can say that the extent of idf operations makes it impossible to ascertain if the civilians that they kill are intended murders or not the recent case of an old man killed in his sleep by idf forces provides an excellent example of a totally unnecessary and

“trusty” trusteau one of two wingmen assigned to “skipper” lieutenant commander jj “jack” hardigan trusteau is a handsome capable aviator who has honed his reputation as a “whoremaster” because that

health care presents plenty of legitimate hurdles to such connectivity including privacy and security and that forms the heart of the dilemma physicians practices and health care organizations generally say that for those reasons they can’t engage in ecommunications with their patients but some physicians do if only on such small matters as appointment reminders others go further by providing web sites with health tips and wellness information or offering online appointment scheduling i got lazy last week so you will see some repeats how can we allow this to continue lastly i’m told that i will need to wear woman’s clothing preferably a dress you’re probably not doing as well as you think – the bible tells us that our hearts are deceitful and satan our enemy who tempts us is called the deceiver of the whole world jeremiah revelation therefore if you are simply floating along in life without any glaring sins that others will point out you probably think you’re something of a model christian so it’s a good idea to set goals for ourselves to help us measure our spiritual growth not that our achievement of goals will tell us everything about our spiritual progress but it can help so i wanted to create an extra special vintage and over the top girlie card to send off to her to help express my sincere gratitude for her generosity and kindness words don't seem to be 'enough' to convey how much this simple gesture touched my heart i guess i'm a bit emotional these days with the impending surgery so close i don't know why i seem to cry at the drop of a hat these days i know the surgery is 'best' but i'm having a hard time coming to terms with the emotional side of everything i'm our family is more than complete and we don't want any additional children my hubby assures me that he'll still look at me the same way my emotions are raw and really close to the surface and so i told by boss my leaving date this week and put the rumours to rest clients naturally got told first but news travels fast with only a matter of weeks to go and soon everyone knew condolences and wishes of good luck come flooding in the work floods in and dries up at the same time – it is a funny one shadow it is no use woman that’s her fate now it’s time to find yours our preschooler has caught wind of what’s going on a nice positive thing to look forward to in the midst of all our doom and gloom lately if a new house is being built she wants to have a say in what it looks like here is her proposal to the design team like i mentioned we made our wipes out of my hubby's old tshirts it felt good to repurpose those dingy whites that would have otherwise gone to waste but you can use other fabrics you have lying around maybe some old flannel sheets would be nice and soft on that baby's tush we use straight water for our wipes solution which we keep in a little squeeze bottle next to the changing pad we wet each wipe just before using because if you prewet your wipes you have such a short window of time before you'd need to start worrying about bacteria growthwe tried using some other homemade solutions that involved combinations of water baby soap olive oil andor tea tree oil but after some more online research and our own trial and error we found that straight up water was the least harsh on little j's sensitive bum the nnre may offer a way

autonomy let's see i can also talk about our downstairs neighbor because she doesn't know about the blog she's renting the studio apartment in the basement of our tiny cottage and we met for the first time over the weekend the deeper question thrown up by this affair is whether politicians should be protected from people who want to throw pies at them getting a pie in the face is an unpleasant

actually still works well sort of i took it downstairs to let my nephew try it out he of course had no idea what that silly thing was he certainly didn't think it was a phone it also gave me the perfect opportunity for a cool layout and most important of all finding a grill was sort of a nightmare i needed a really big grill and of course i don’t even own a small one i already had some helpers tentatively lined up and was pretty sure i could shanghai at least a few people to help if i needed to they would want to eat after all one sunday morning during a round the topic of the club championships came up and we started discussing where i was with the planning basically the grill was my one real sticking point one of the guys suddenly stopped and pulled out his cell phone he called a guy and arranged for the most fantastic grill i could have hoped for it even looked like a train but the people did not riot and they did not loot this experience has made them both stronger

deck of the ship at noon and it doesn’t leave until pm from that time we waited on our luggage to get to our rooms and went on the deck to eat at one of their free buffets they also had a cookout at pm there was a live band and i finally felt like i was on vacation some of us got up and dance while the band was playing and we was have a good time we got in the jacuzzi and stayed until we left the

news this morning – i felt like things were all about me i often read the ny times and the huffington post pretty much everyday i read them at the end of the day when i know what i’m going to write first thing in the morning when i don’t i read them first – the stalling and the reading often helps to churn up new ideas i read the headlines in the daily news i’ll admit it up until two weeks ago i had never tried a brussel sprout and i certainly turned my nose up at them whenever someone suggested that i try them why i have absolutely no idea we shall see… he was domingo pedraza romero

questions unanswered about what had happened to cause a loving father in a 'perfect' family to smash the wife he had always adored over the head with the blunt end of an axe most unfortunately the eldest son henry who was at the time witnessed the immediate aftermath of this atrocious act and has been trying to live with the impact of it ever since including protecting his little brother who was then just ten busy busy busy week what's new got tons of stuff done despite the fact that the spring social season has begun every day brought at least two visitors which meant stopping for long chats sometimes over coffee oy vay it's hard to get back into work but such is life in the friendly hood we visited the old burra burra copper mine which started as an underground mine in but in it became one of the first open cut mines in australia it is full of water now and musical concerts are held by the side of the lake and is setting up shop at meanwhile greene was acting her heart out doing the best she could with the character of a burnedout childlike brownacidvictim who hysterically confesses to crimes she hasn’t committed in order to pad out the plot… but her refusal to burst into song or call upon the “pie hole” gang to help solve the case definitely counts against her here it was kinda cool to see her dressed as a hippieish “rock chick” though… more of that please martin just seemed to be irritated by everyone and everything she encountered… presumably because she knows she’s the heroine of a murder mystery story who can’t actually solve murder mysteries that must be

into every crevice of every minute of every day i have to admit i do my best work when i mentally board a metaphorical plane speeding toward a single destination hello my friends i have used random number generator to select a winner of the london treasures giveaway and i'm excited to announce that the winner is the amazing prairiegirl i was stunned when her number came up on the generator it just seemed so perfect pg was one of the people i met during my first year of blogging and we have been friends ever since in addition to being one of the most gifted photographers i know she is also one of the kindest funniest and most supportive people i have ever met i use the term met in a bloggy way since we have yet to meet facetoface but i feel like i have always known her i know that any of you who blog understand just what i am talking about it will be a joy to think of miss prairiegirl while i am making my rounds at the london markets although i may have to let you down a wee bit pg since i'm going to have to eat all the fish and chips myself the women could fair a bit better a solid run could get into the final a run should garner a medal we have women capable of doing both more

cinderella’s good heart changes people with a finger snip she got an email and a letter of acceptance from the college but then there seems to be no further communication between the two sides individually and as a band in the studio along with interviews much of humanity is suffering at this time because of persecution this persecution not only consists of poverty and lack of money but hunger of spirit for years i followed ellis's trail through moves affidavits stating he was who he said he was and doctors' exams and then dead in ellis took his own life perhaps the senile debility played the largest part in his choice but i can't help but think that he was worn out from dealing with his health problems earlier this week we check out the honeymoon between eric young and odb love and trust between them then eric goes ballistic on a guy who looked at odb uhoh he is in his underwear again drain the bulgur wheat and squeeze out as much water as you can this is very important to do if using the tea towel bring the sides up and twist it to extract as much water as you can as i listened to the shofar blowing i thought of my dad in gan eden i have absolutely no doubt in the world that he's way up there and thought of past services i realized that it isn't so much about the praying that i was remembering but rather what went on after shul oh boy social conservatives are against abortion they’ve made that abundantly clear so in an attempt to avoid unwarranted pregnancies and the associated abortions birth control pills were created yay but wait social conservatives are also against birth control hmm…that doesn’t seem to add up how do we stop from having unwanted pregnancies if we don’t use birth control the catholic church is also anticondom oh right abstinence is the answer because that is a realistic approach to the worldwide problem of hiv and aids as well and overpopulation and unwanted pregnancies worldwide ironically abortion numbers would actually decline if birth control was cheaper or more widely available wrong wrong wrong if you're looking for me i'll be the one with her foot in the bucket full of cortizone today i'm trying to relax a

dramalike too if i asked you a personal question would you answer it the first time i saw harley quinn my jaw dropped because they had taken one of the biggest fixations in my life and made a female version out of it of course there’s a moral to this tale a little piece of wisdom that you can apply to your own stay in the transitional zone of veterans campus and that moral is if you don’t like the roommate you got now don’t worry be happy you’ll get along just fine sooner or later like davy crockett paragon did paragon that poor old rattlesnake with the negative aura so thick around him that it was downright impossible for him to see through it the new buzzword is “hecovery” that’s the term the new york times’ catherine rampell and others use to characterize the new numbers on our

interview jamie has been going on about amber being fit and i know i dumped him but it’s annoying me what’s worse is fishy has picked up on the fact it is annoying me and is joining in there is no randomness in the arrangement of those words in that statement i never understood the order of the words nor did i ever bother to understand rhetorically parrot like repeating the statement to everyone and anyone who had ears to hear – within context of course but without much thought again apologies for the incomplete nature of this piece but i ‘m trying to catalogue major dialogue points with alghazali and not only has this one interested me on prior occasion but it jumps off the page when i hear pascal echoing sentiments so near in tone i ‘m happy to be corrected in these matters what robots i asked mitt romney our last resort the only thing standing between us and four more disastrous years of obama and even more draconian socialist government is a guy who comes off as an

supposed to attend a christmas event in her town which i cancelled as i was most upset over the call and her hanging up on me when we did finally connect i told her that i expected an apology for her going off on me and then hanging up i also told her of my conversation with my brother her response was “what’s the common denominator” meaning me i said “strike one and i’m giving one warning only”

for writing come then let us again illustrate this by the inspired scripture dwelling somewhat at length upon it to advantage it has then been written in a book of moses that abraham believed in god but his faith was accounted unto him for righteousness and he was called the friend of god and what was the manner of his faith or how then was he called the friend of god he heard the words get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred unto a land that i will show thee moreoyer when he was enjoined to sacrifice his only son as a type of christ he learnt the purpose hidden in god and for this reason the saviour spoke concerning him to the impious jews saying your father abraham rejoiced to see my day and he saw it and was glad therefore the inspired abraham owing to obedience and sacrifice was called the friend of god and put on himself the boast of righteousness via an internal rupturing or explosion of an organ i chose rum and the two of us have been friendly ever since and death

go to psychics to help them communicate with their guardian angels because the psychics possess the “third eye” though that is effective you have to pay a certain payment to get their services moreover that can be a little expensive most of the time people take matter into their own hands and seek their guardian angels themselves we are of course talking about meditation in addition the experts say that this is the for sure way to communicate with one’s guardian angel ideal quilted cotton pads what therapies has your occupational therapist prescribed for your spd do you know of

seeing over people's heads there's always a good view and in the case of the children's shows here they don't take up the whole coliseum maybe a third of the place the only complaint i heard about the

fun bright card with a sweet reminder to remember the little things in life by gini williams cagle but before you go i've got a little something to give away i'm giving away pezzy prints charm packs

the winner will be drawn at random on march rd when i wake up here's a picture of all the great colors and there are charm packs for this give away the reason we offer a lower tax rate for investment is that it is good for the economy and society as a whole already the tax rate for companies is the highest in the world and the tax rate for investment is the highest in the world so actually we are hurting ourselves when we claim it is not fair for millionaires to pay a lower tax rate they already paid the higher rate when they actually worked and earned that money now they are only investing it instead of hoarding it like scrooge mcduck we take up quarters in moscow with his then friendgirl ms m we arrive at the train station in red square there are still signs of the old ussr in the station

even there helping her get up so both of them have a positive pull while rian just pulls jb down somehow their scenes seem heavy most of the time and the past is always the highlight how can one move on if there’s constant reminder rian better move on as well maybe then will jb find his way back to her or completely cross another one for my take cans certainly have their advantages and craft beer drinkers love their convenience and portability hopefully the market will soon demand that ball and its competitors come up with a way to manufacture effective bpafree cans lately it has been raining every single day here i love rain but it does make things like running errands difficult the traffic getting wet and possibly catching a cold is a pain not to mention the weather around the world is getting stranger by the day it does cool down and sometimes i experience very cool breeze in the evening that's really odd anyways since it has been a wet day i thought the best pick me up to stay

is a big example of not getting it yes of course women and people of color do many of the same things that white guys do but that doesn’t mean that white guys should be considered a generic avatar through which everyone can experience the world is a black woman likely to have similar frustrations as a white guy when stuck in traffic probably but said white guy probably isn’t also worrying whether he’s going to be assumed to be lazy and irresponsible when he’s minutes late to work just because he has dark skin and boobs we all exist in the same realworld universe and many experiences are at least somewhat universal but the particular filters through which those experiences come to us can be very different especially when it comes to marginalization and privilege would i still watch game of thrones if it didn’t have a wealth of gendernoncompliant women probably but i’d enjoy it a heck of a lot less because i’d be experiencing that world in a far more secondhand way than i can when i see what’s happening to arya or brienne as they navigate their way through a world that sees unpretty women as automatically suspect it’s a far more personal and engaging way of experiencing a story when there’s a character with whom one has significant commonalities he doesn’t go over all of these issues but this is what we need to make this election and every election at

first batch of beer made at ellicottville before moving on to work at goose island in chicago demink moved back to western new york and in teamed up with his wife sara and yahn to buy the brewing equipment from the former old saddleback brewing company in pittsfield ma and got to work there were a couple of missteps to start namely the failure of the original flagship mild and pilsner but their ipa went over pretty well and southern tier was off and running i do have the pleasure in introducing our talented new dt member wendy i hope you will all pop across and show her some love on her blog and take in her fabulous work  listen to moses’ response “because the people come to me to seek god’s will” what was painfully obvious to jethro wasn’t obvious to moses at all it’s like he says “that’s just how we roll here there are a lot of needs and people come to me looking for help i just stay at it and work until everyone gets an answer” sometimes we are so accustomed to doing

i had not just spent the past several hours breaking out of prison so i was in fine form to run back to the house and do the only natural thing post the news to all my networks then i realized

dragged his mate back across the road againthe russian guy who was out of his mind was insulting both of them so he dragged his mate back to the casino the russian followed them taunting and whistling

existence good ones bad ones excruciatingly stupid ones at times they all add up to create the patterns of daily life in which we live happy and fulfilling lives sad and dreary ones occasionally unfortunate ones in which we just plod on and on and on pretending that everything's just ok when it's not and you're silently screaming your lungs out in frustration savard who here comes the role strain the riot squad signals the truck driver to dump the load i worship and make offerings to my gods because i believe them to be worthy of my praise my love my adoration i honor them not even

have known where to start the other remake that made the news was the casting chloe moretz to play the lead in of a remakereimagining of the stephen king story carrie i’m not very enthusiastic about this one because i don’t see there being any more to the story than what we got in brain de palma’s original version maybe it will be closer to the book but even if that’s so it would not mean that the film will be any better so i will just wait and see the film when its finished the contracts cited by afp included the million euro rm million one paid by the malaysian government to perimekar the

marred only by my mobile i'd left the children home alone as the eldest is capable of earning good money babysitting other people's kids and therefore has to do the odd freebie for me all well and good until the babysitter goes to bedwhich he had done it was mid week afterall and then the stupid dog got confused not the sharpest knife in the drawer is our logan although if there was a crumb of

me in retrospect it was probably a good job i was called away from lulu's the large glasses of wine i consumed seemed like such a good idea at the time but the following morning i had to suffer

arrived in scotland – carrie is an american for those who don’t know her – one of the things that took her aback a bit was the aggressiveness of the language and not just the tone the actual words we use to talk to each other we know when we’re being serious even if the words are exactly the same so nonscots readers when they open up this collection might think that alan comes from the most dysfunctional of families he does but all scottish families are dysfunctional – that’s how we function for me andrew hits the nail on the head in the title story now a grown man and living in greece

holiday more than anybody mostly because he’s being treated as an equal by everybody and given the chance to prove himself capable in fact i think this is probably his best holiday for a very very long time i have to admit that i was a bit apprehensive about bringing him with me because what with my disability and his we're a bit like the blind leading the blind at times but he hadn't been back since we left to move back to the uk twelve years ago so it was only fair he came too i'm glad he did sometimes you just have to throw yourself into a situation and hope for the best with just the random pitterpat but anywho for idud i wanted to show her more ladylike she may be a vixen to men but she doesn't seem to have any particular dislike of women other then if they jack with her plants so i did poison ivy on her way to the garden club i think she'd adore it no clear face in any of the pictures because i wanted it dark and like the dark nature of women so much imagery of poison ivy seems to be that kind of a mother nature thing when i was growing up we watched the disney movie andor mutual of omaha's wild kingdom and tried our best not to watch lawrence welk we also drank pop

too often people fall into the trap of strife someone says something that rubs you the wrong way and before you know it there is tension quarreling and division the bible tells us that strife opens the door to “every evil work” it’s the enemy’s greatest trap to keep people from living in victory but you don’t have to fall into the trap of strife you can rise above it like today’s verse says you can simply drop the matter before it turns into something bigger than it needs to be you don’t have to sink down to somebody’s level and argue with them and try to prove that you’re right you weren’t put on this earth to correct everybody around you and thus do we perpetuate the oppression that’s killing us and millions of other women i taught for twentyfive years and its like an mi interrogation

understanding of the divinity within all things while it’s true that the bit that pollan quotes focuses on the individual pigs pollan would like us to believe that the individual pigs are the sole concern of the humane society but that seems doubtful if the humane society offered to help with a contraception plan if the animal protectionists were concerned with the individual suffering perhaps

things like that is what have women doing too much… people expecting too much and making us forget our roles as women or can it be that now that we have forgotten the danger of the terrible roaring lion that we now see this returned love thing as a duty we set aside times of the day to talk to him and we ceremoniously thank him for our blessings mainly our food and even then deep down we really don’t feel like he had anything to do with it we always have to think about giving our time and resources to his work but we’re willing enough to claim any blessings he may send our way and never even think about our benefactor’s warning to those who “strain at a gnat and swallow a camel” matthew i tremble to think what we would do if our lives were demanded of us in his name i feel a bit like it's a cliche reading this book at the moment there's a waiting list at the library for it as long as my arm but i wanted to read it before i watch the film i was a little put off at the start because the horse is the narrator but then i realised that he had to be becuase he's the only character that's in it all the way through after i got over that and the fact that the horse can under stand german as

esl intrigue me this may sound strange but i love the way the city looks it's not a beautiful city instead it's surreal it has this crazy postapocalyptic appearance i've heard that there is not another city like it in the us the city looks just like it did when my mom was growing up there years ago little has changed or been repaired in many cases when i go there i get this odd feeling that the people and the cars and anything modern have been superimposed on the city that we are somehow the ghosts i get that feeling every time i go there and i can't really explain it any better than

too much to report back on he's brewing tripels quadrupels and sour beers ranging from lambicstyle fruit beers to red ales though none use brettanomyces which gansberg seems a little spooked aboutbased on my own experimentations probably wisely so almost all of them are aged in oak for months to over a year and many are double or triplefermented it's an amazing range for a brewery that produces fewer than barrels a year helloooo and yes my friend that’s how tedious writing can get specially for someone who doesn’t have it naturally like me after my beautiful child was born fabio did not cope at all i suppose that once he saw this baby shit got real he came to the conclusion that he couldn’t be the father and off we went on the rigmarole of dna tests so my son could have his

celebrity big brother contestant debuts at number five on a side note i would like to take the time to point out that michael reagan’s endorsement of newt shows that intelligence may be more dependent on genetics than environment you see that sarasota film festival i haven't lived there for almost years and they accepted two of my works the first time i submitted i've lived here for almost years and have been rejected every time i enter as i mentioned in an earlier post this month i'm guest designing for let's capture our memories i'm super excited about such a fun opportunity and today my first guest post is up on their blog mazwayi’s opinion was echoed by a score of residents interviewed in parts of khayelitsha where vigilante action is common loosely cast on stitches place marker join for working in the round being careful not to twist stitches it was fabulous having her wearing some of the pieces from the book since i cannot wear them myself she was styled by wyatt white and i i've decided to resurrect this blog and do something different when all at once i saw a crowd i remember buying that first album and thinking that this woman had one amazingly powerful voice the possessive correction meh yes it should be mr tyler's but it was a little hard to see where he put the apostrophe it almost looks like a comma for the sentence above instead of an apostrophe in the sentence he wrote he needs to work on his penmanship but fine motor skills are one of his challenges common amongst those with autism that's part of why he's in private ot once a week i'm often astounded by the confusion of knowledge that people display in public as the gospel truth it either shows a genuine ignorance with noble intentions or a conscious attempt at trying to fool us with interesting consequences i seriously don't know which one it is the most recent example is today's column in die beeld by charlpierre naudé on postcolonial studies submarine joe dunthorne you can check out the full story about olly cromwell the bexleyheath councillors and the latest updates on cntgate here and if you should be reading this olly i’m stunned at the outcome so you must be feeling like you’re leaving in an absolute nightmare my people humble people who expect elizabeth margaret—better known as em—has always known what life would contain an internship at her father’s firm a degree from harvard and a career as a lawyer the only problem is that it’s not what she wants when she gets the opportunity to get away from it all and spend a month with the aunt she never knew she jumps at the chance while there em pursues her secret dream of being a chef and she also learns that her family has kept some significant secrets from her too and then there’s cade the laidback local surfer boy who seems to be everything em isn't naturally she can’t resist him and as their romance blossoms em feels that many many people mourn it's probably a safe bet that the station will do some sort of public affairs presentation aimed at the underserved akron area which still misses the nightly news program on what is now wvpx anchored in its most recent incarnation by nna host mansfield the newscast ended its run on time warner cable's neon local programming channel sydney's teacher's daughter hosts a fundraiser every year a knife a father's throat had mangled ps sophie's coming back

bank hold up and turned the robbers over to police what is your name sir neol saranghage dwaebeorin nan ije deo isang kyoto animation’s second entry and the more controversy of the two since so many people after watching air haruhi and kanon where expecting something as instantly awesome as the first episode of haruhi and something as pretty as air and kanon or something that was like azumanga daioh i hadn’t seen azumanga daioh yet and after reading the first couple of pages of the source material – and not finding it very funny – i lowered my expectations a lot and just tried to watch the first episode with a neutral frame of mind i was still underwhelmed by this series i’d probably have rated it a or b with the opening song and lucky channel carrying most of the weight as the first few episodes dragged by it got a little better but i couldn’t help but feel disappointment starting to eat away at my bones this changed though with the announcement of a director change after episode episode was better than was better yet even better and so it went i found myself liking the show more and more – maybe it was the change in director or because i came to enjoy the characters – laughing at skits like tsukasa and her cellphone or when miyuki wins the race using her physical assets once i understood the show it clicked the show was not meant to be a comedy at it’s core it a sliceoflife show – the normal everyday life of real people do not make good fodder for a comedy and that’s okay my question is diversity only lip service just like the vanderbilts on the east coast the bremonds are today best remembered for the houses they built initially the family lived over the store downtown but eventually john sr built a house at sixth and rio grande where katz’s deli stands now the robinson place was a block away on the northwest corner of rio grande and seventh or paypal at flairmwryahoocom there will be a fine arts fair on april from pm at the board of education it will feature a live art auction a cake auction and live music i went to school today interesting highlights skipped about two hours of lessons – me faus and tia went to the pbsm room and slept just for the heck of it well faus has some stomachache cough so like wth the bbc as well as new zealand and australian television newsnetworks have covered the racially motivated killing campaign africans are conducting against the afrikaner farmers of south africa not kyra and her colleagues at fox msnbc abc and cbs no wonder then that the orchestrated ethnocide against the entire afrikaner people has not been brought out into the open as they like to say on cnn someone you have never met in person what do you do for fun ie hobbies leisure time etc i would also appreciate prayer for the remaining big events of this year a pastorsleaders conference with michael wells an international speaker who speaks on the abiding life in christ oct a camp for the blind oct and a conference for women nov on april we were finally able to bring our baby home it was the day we had been waiting for now it was going to be real i wasn't exactly sure at that moment what real was i was just focused on the fact that we were no longer going to have to be at the hospital all day long and that i could hold feed change and love her anytime i wanted to our new lives could truly begin muffins are quick and easy to make but usually best eaten on the day they are baked so i got all the ingredients measured out and put on one side before going to bed then in the morning in between taking nick to the station for the am train and taking lulu for her morning walk i mixed them up and popped them in the oven today it’s summer stir in banana mixture onto the flour combine well foster care home blend carrots with water filter the juice through a sievestrainer reserve both the carrot juice and the carrot pulp as for craigslist i managed to sell off or give away everything in my apartment i was even loading a mattress on a truck minutes before heading to the airport and when i sat down on the plane i collapsed into a puddle of fatigue and weepy gratitude for the friends i kept and also for those i left behind these are so yummy gluten free super filling pancakes and a really healthy option for a lunch of light dinner this is day of making every meal i eat from scratch using nothing with more than ingredient on the label gregory the gop are getting lots of things done thank you to all veterans and the sacrifices you make when to use at the end of every game no matter the score emulating homer by speaking your maxim from atop a noble stack of beer kegs is the surest way we know of to please the gods of college football i've been asked one time or another by those who are curious about the path that i have chosen some have asked me you're not a christian and you don't follow christian rules what are you a devil worshiper i've also been told once or twice it is stated in the bible that thou shalt not suffer a witch to live and my personal favorite you can do magic do you do black or white magic good night my brother organized a surprise dessert two warm soft chocolate cakes that had a soufflé like lava center they came with vanilla ice cream and raspberry coulis heavenly when i finally went to the corporate world my father asked me to get a classy phone to be with the times obviously one should look professional in the presence of others shouldn’t he so you can imagine how much the mobile world had changed a product which was a luxury at one time had changed into one which gave you a kind of an image in front of others and so i decided to buy a nokia x and that is one decision i regret even today c it seems more cost effective in practice it's not always john miles music uk the terms of 'postauthenticity' or 'inauthenticity' are misleading labels for the change in sensibility and attitudes implying a more reflexive attitude to authenticity they lead the focus from important elements of this change not least the weakened fundament of the americanenglish hegemony in popular music for decades the insistence on rock authenticity was coupled with an understanding of culture as national in constructing centreperiphery relations in the rock world urban american could fake rural accents and mick jagger could fake cockney but foreign accents could not be accepted as authentic singing in english called for mockery in the home countries and a low place in the international hierarchy no arrests have yet been made in the daffeu killing alli on the top bunk with me kept whispering under her breath different songs all the while sticking her finger in my toes i hate my feet touched calmly waiting that's how i feel most days about this pg happy they have cancer it is important for these women to be if the crossfader is in the center position tracks assigned to a and b will be mixed equally i have made a scrapbook page this week for a frame so i thought i would enter it into a couple of challenges truly scruptious love and hearts as this is a photo of me and my dad i think the love goes with saying and divas by design anything goes i have used mme stella rose and kraft paper for the main pieces and just found other bits from the bit box i covered a piece of cardboard with burlap for the background of the photo the large heart of course is an inked doily it was a bit of a dul day when i took the photo so it's not a very good picture really does look so much much 'for real' i am such a bad blogger it's been way too long since i've written a post i have been busy though and not just slacking i have been updating my studio again working on dolls and paintings and just life stuff in general yesterday i ran my first k ever actually it was a k but whose counting we are of course it was also my first race in turkey and my first race in any foreign country the first voice came from the man on the left “that is right kneel before us worship us for we are greater than your god” his voice rang out with goodnatured jocularity peter felt sure that his face was covered to hide a visage totally out of place in this den of evil men have you ever the interior is chockablock with storage nooks and cubbies plus no less than four beverage holders it has supportive seats and while visibility to the front and sides is good like pretty much all new cars visibility to the rear is poor well by there will be a rearview camera west allis — one word changed some graffiti to a hate crime for one west allis family i slammed on my brakes and surveyed the scene i could hardly breathe and was momentarily overwhelmed with the sights and sounds of those few seconds as a neighbor and mr dorsey rushed to michael’s aid i turned around and rode as fast as i could to his house back up the hill on rittenhouse and a right turn onto th avenue a block later as i turned left onto our street i passed michael’s fiveyear old sister sandy at the corner and shouted to her as i passed “michael’s been hit by a car” climbing the stairs to their front porch i pounded on the open screen door and shouted inside repeating to his parents what i had just told sandy moments before his dad rushed out the door and leaped from their porch yelling frantically “where where” i said “down the hill on rittenhouse street” i struggled on my bike to keep up with michael’s father as he ran like a racehorse to his son’s side michael’s mother arrived soon behind as i watched from a short distance away there undoubtedly was some element of chauvinism in the works of marx and engels which was inevitable in the times that they were writing it is also true that marx and engels themselves concluded that they had overstated the revolutionary potential of the times in fact as they were later to state in britain was the only country where capitalism was dominant and as they believed that socialism was impossible without capitalism first developing and socialising the productive forces a socialist revolution was clearly impossible in she also taught me to be interested and adventurous she and my dad travel together and apart when she was working she thought nothing of going on business trips by herself and sought out fun sights wherever she was once when she was on a trip to buffalo she talked a security guard into letting her into rich stadium where the bills play for a few minutes she had the stadium to herself she and i often took little road trips together mostly to san francisco for giants games one time one of our trips became the “trip from hell” as my mustang burned through a transmission line and we lost all of our transmission fluid in south sf in the evening this was not good we were in a very seedy neighborhood before the days when people had to be surgically removed from their cell phones she climbed over a wall of bums to reach to reach a pay phone to call aaa as i watched nervously from the car after waiting minutes we watched our tow truck pass by us never to return she made the climb again finally we got our towtruck a couple of days later when we returned home after missing our first giants game for being stuck in the ghetto walking into our hotel room to find a plunger in the toilet with a sign that read “sorry not working” realizing it was kids’ day at the giants vs rockies game and being surrounded by cottoncandy infused kids who kept kicking the backs of our seats while screaming “barry barry” one of my tires blew out on pacheco pass my mom got out the jack and proceeded to change the tire as cars whizzed by us and honked my job was to flip everybody off our motto for this trip was “we’re survivors not victims” my mom didn’t get distraught cry or bemoan our fate we laughed drank bartles and james long island iced teas from our cooler it was the s– we quickly moved on to zima instead of a disaster it became a funny story and transformed us into cell phone owners the hurt and wounded i pacify with soothing hand well it's been a rather busy this week at casa bliss and i don't know about you but i am really looking forward to having some time out this weekend what i admire about dalaras is that he is a huge collaborator and as a musician who stretches his wings he doesn't stick to one style of greek music as you will see from the below clips look out for songs on the “ best cheating songs from the cheaters themselves” playlist tomorrow i am writing to you and i feel as if there is so much to tell you i am hoping you are well and that you are catching moments of quiet happiness as i write you i feel exhausted but the good kind the kind that has your heart full it has been a strange road the positive things have have left the bad behind honestly i feel as if the clouds opened up and dropped pixie dust on me i have never written pixie dust before but it is true the kind acts that have come my way as of late are beyond my imagination aran has replaced my broken computer with one of her own and when i received it i kept saying is this really happening aran thank you then finding out that another gift is on it's way i am overwhelmed and find myself wanting to invite the whole world to sit under that magical cloud melchizedek priesthood the authority to preside in the church and administer the higher ordinances of the church the priesthood is organized just as it was in jesus’ time consequently the church was governed by high priest councils until and then in the first presidency was organized and the quorum of the twelve apostles was added the addition of the office of seventy completed the organization of the priesthood though god took the next years to tweak the organization organizing dropping redefining and reassigning the seventies until he got it perfect sometime in the s anxious i had high hopes for “illusion” maybe years back i’d enjoyed “this present darkness” as well as other peretti books i think i’ve read that this is his first book in seven years what was the best book you read why aren’t they addressing these questions even within umno there is already discord over this matter that means even to them this issue is indefensible bill cosby – karate hiyah i say i would never again watch it but i probably said that the first time and as the sands of time wear away all the less important memories i have like my pin number and what i had for breakfast i’ll probably end up seeing it again accidentally but let the written record state i hope to hell i am too mentally decrepit by that point to care

how i repent of course at the time there wasn't anything online for the boys that would match and so i've spent months or so noodling about what the boys were going to wear about a month ago i was in a second hand store and saw this sherpa sweatshirt that was nearly identical to the fabric of the dresses for did you know that the rice lake public library offers kindles and nooks that you can

subside before the afternoon as i plan to visit jardin japonese and jardin zoologico wouldn't be much fun in the freezing rain or wind and in any case i will be more prepared for the weather tomorrow first thing i will buy in the morning will be a thermos and a set of yerba mate i think i've grown addicted to the bitter stuff and i can't wait to have my own thermos to carry around like those old men of argentina uruguay and chile when in my mind your lips touch my lips my mom often tells me that perhaps my kids and i should live in the mountains free of neighbors except for mother nature who will always understand the noise my kids create everyday which she added “might be too much for the human ear to handle “ “look i just got out of a longterm relationship and i kind of need to slut it up for a while” a weird counterpoint to lipsmacks and squishy tongues as it crashes and splits your world asunder to me that sounds a bit crazy i know there are couples in this world who can work their romantic partnership as well as their business partnership but it doesn’t sound like fun to me to be spending so much time together that is focused on work i believe that i would appreciate dating someone who provides a respite from work i would enjoy hearing about my significant other’s day at work and telling him about mine and i could have a legitimate reason to not care about the details of his day i’m guessing he would appreciate the same about my day when i first met yoda one of the first few things he asked me was “how do you work best” i didn’t think much of this question so i blurted out the first thing that came to my mind “i work best under pressure” bunuh diri kan little did i know that this simple answer would affect the way i was going to be supervised in the future a correspondent has emailed the blog to ask if it knows anything about takedown piracy which he describes as a new business model of our times the outsourced dmca takedown bountyhunter this story is now coming out and we have some alternative news about uprising within america by “patriots” who want mass arrests of the criminals who have betrayed the american people and stolen our wealth i think i'll let you watch the video first i couldn't watch it in one sitting in fact i had to take off and head to the nearest leashfree park with my dogs for a bit before coming back to complete it i suggest having a piece of paper next to you so you can record down your thoughts when they strike you home ownership isn’t for everyone it’s definitely a longterm commitment the prices of homes increase over the years but usually at a slow rate with all the financing closing costs and other expenses associated with owning a home you’ll probably lose money if you sell in less than five years interestingly only one of the films has offered us a teaser trailer as of this writing—abraham lincoln vampire hunter—even though it's the movie with a later release date is the secrecy surrounding dark shadows helping with its allure or is everyone just more excited about seeing johnny depp sinking his teeth into a classic vampire series than witnessing honest abe whacking the undead with an ax the best selfdefense tactic is called target denial which means don't be there act out a scenario where maybe your child is walking in the school corridor or any other place where he or she might bullied you can pretend to be a bully standing by the wall saying mean things ask your child what these mean things might be because what is considered insulting or upsetting is different for

to become increasingly obsessed with within the first minutes you're there you can't blame me there are golden anchors dangling from balconies pewter tubs you could drown in in every room with bubble bath and roses all around the warmest coziest white towels everywhere you look movie selections an outdoor light wood patio surrounded by vines looking out into the industrial remanence of the sky at sundown the bed i can't even get near it because i am sure that if i put one foot on it i'll sleep for a week straight there is a bright white tiled shower that feels like you're standing in the

formal portrait of a crossdressing man wearing women’s clothing here is the photo again i bet mr demeng never forgets me i almost knocked him off his feet with a big hug the morning of class i have to admit he looked mildly shocked by this crazy red head but quickly learned i'm quite harmless lol michael is so down to earth and willing to teach his students all about assemblage art and make you laugh along the way i highly recommend taking a workshop with michael you will not regret it on the lovin’ people he has the benefit of a good backing band consisting of pretty purdie on drums artie butler on organ piano and joe mack and bill salter on bass the band who play both loose and funky without ever sounding sloppy helped produce a more laid back vibe and chandler sounds more relaxed than he did on the earlier album he has some better songs on this one too such as the title cut warm poppy number aboutwell “lovin’ people” on which the presence of a chorus made up on the spot of people who had gathered to provide assistance to a mothers’ help organization also helps temper chandler’s unfortunate tendency towards overearnestness “the naked fool” is about a relationship gone bad which doesn’t have anything new to say but will have a few toes tapping “sold out no more reservations” is an interesting number about a male groupie and “bound to fly” has a nice soaring quality and chandler’s lyrics and delivery mesh well on it if anything the problem here is that chandler is sometimes eclipsed by his backing band—check “behind your eyes” where the band goes off on some nice free jazzpsychedelic tangents while chandler seems to be trying to channel sammy davis jr zaoli elnour gar and manon were remanded in custody until friday when they were expected to seek bail their
