"i am a big movie fan as anybody that knows me well is already aware of while i've delved into my favorite movies numerous times with many different people i haven't broached the subject yet on this blog therefore over the course of several blogs not to be posted back to back i will go through my favorites i'm not necessarily going to go by genre i'm just going to do it as it comes to me regardless of the unique little spot that springsteen holds in your heart it’s difficult to deny the extent of his incredible legacy his is one that for all practical purposes began in the mid s and is still just as relevant and powerful today as it probably was back then okay i’m i wasn’t born yet if estelle is the “fonzie of female rappers” then springsteen is the derek jeter of american songwriters — an ageless impossibly reliable model of consistency please remove jeter’s season from consideration for this analogy to work springsteen’s timeless value as an american songwriter and musician is paralleled by few others and you would be remiss not to consider his name in the same realm as cohen dylan and guthrie a great war leaves the country with three armies an army of cripples an army of mourners and an army of thieves german proverb will margaretha recover from her fundamentalism before it’s too late will gösta deviate from a life filled with selfpity and broken hearted females film history demands that in addition to these questions we ask what greta’s been up to all this time the answer is not much though the final act of the film is largely hers there are many problems that arise to a person because of which he has to face a lot of problems for treating them in this way there is a problem that mostly happens to kids and they are sometimes habitual to it the name of that problem is eczema it is a problem that happens with a kid due to itching and rubbing on a same part of body for a long time there is a solution available to most of the people for the problem and that is cream for eczema this cream is available in most of the parts of the world and on many medical shops generally they are of low cost and are affordable from every section of society its application can provide relief to the children from the problem which they are facing actually the victim’s friend a young woman tried to pull him back into his car attackers came after her

hysterical could scream only their location we knew we had just lost the queen’s speech was keeping me awake we'll see how i do wish me luck with my goals ever made i know that's a pretty dry dock brewing co alexander nevesky russian imperial stout you cannot unschool only until you disapprove of what your children choose to do if you're happily unschooling during a time when your children are willingly and by choice doing math workbooks and reading the classics daily but quickly step in with enforced curricula when your children instead start choosing to play games and read back issues of people magazine for a while you weren't unschooling in the first place if you don't plan on respecting your children's choices in learning even when you'd prefer they be doing something else then you're not unschooling oz beef broth however i really enjoy spending time with kids not just mine melissa bynes brooks is the editor of brookssleepreview i love using this palette for work the soft colors and subtle shimmer are always appropriate and gives me a break from my usual browns if you love neutrals or simply looking for eyeshadows to wear at work or school i highly recommend that you check out this palette as well as the rest of armani’s maestro quads this was a great shop since it was mostly foodsnackcoffee stuff that we use i'm planning to put the chocolate bars in with mrsmith's father's day gift tomorrow and the coffee will become part of my kids' endofyear gifts the avocado scientific name persea americana is a native of south and central america it was also

make out a small white speck my friends i tell you the truth that speck is a man riding yes i said riding his ice chest dad was screaming disgustedly about goop coming out of them as he stomped on them and mom was gesturing for me to come inside i couldn’t move i was frozen in my tracks i couldn’t take one step forward lest the goop “get” me or a caterpillar fell on my head i literally think it took the better side of an hour to get me in the house i nearly had a tantrum out of intense fear i just knew that the one giant caterpillar over the door was going to flop off and touch me watching her feeling her work whiles others watches we color matched the box into a behr ultra base as well cotton fabric that would match the cardigan it doesn't need to be the same color but it needs to either blend in with the cardigan or have contrast and match with the flowers that you will accessorize the cardigan with i also wanted to share my opinion on the beautyblender sponge since you do see it on picture of the tutorial i know some people received the sponge in their february birchbox but sadly i wasn’t one of those lucky people after hearing so much about this amazing liquid foundation applicator i had to get it i used my birchbox points box and feedback points to purchase this item for free although it is a little pricey i received sponges for from the birchbox website i know sonia kashuk also has a foundation sponge but it’s a thicker less squishy sponge and harder to roll along the face for that airbrushed look because of the groove in the middle of the sponge you can get the beautyblender sponge at ulta sephora and tons of other places online its is very easy to use wet it and apply and its reusable another great thing is that this sponge does not soak up the foundation and waste product as the disposable foam sponges do beautyblender also makes a cleaner to go with sponge the only cons i can think of are that it is pretty expensive for a sponge and it does stain why i love you for the back i finished it off as per this tutorial i didn't have any doublesided tape in the house though so it's just sitting there under it's own pressure at the moment average pace bishop alan hopes auxiliary bishop of westminster said “the fact the chapel house was founded as a house of prayer and healing and is now home to an abortion provider is a tragic betrayal of the life and mission of dorothy kerin” for my card i printed out a digi stamp i had from bugaboo stamps stella and gus series i laughed when i bought it and i am laughing right now i do think the voices in my head make a lot of sense most of the time and i guess that scares everyone except me more from last week matt banter with ”congratulationsman…” in the crowd what’s next for miriam halahmy i understand hidden is one of three novels published by meadowside books could you tell us a little about the next two novels all of these struggles that i have mentioned only become more complicated for a guy when you introduce a girl into the picture moved away from home it’s not the market’s job to tell authors how to monetize their work the market doesn’t care if there’s no scarcity of what they want it’s hard to get them to pay for it this is a physical attack the bible say that our mouths are sharp and deadly poison it also says that gods word is a sharp two edged sword that cuts to the bone and marrow it was hard to regard terms like “good” “competent” “caring” and “intelligent” as anything other than positive and to regard terms like “bad” “untrustworthy” “arrogant” and “selfish” as anything other than negative i put “environmentecofriendly” and “progressive” into the positive camp because while everyone has different ideas of what environmental policies should be enacted and different ideas of what constitutes progressive it is generally agreed now that the a degree of environmentallyfriendly policy is positive and that being progressive in the vague sense of moving forward is also positive in other words they’re like “democracy” or “human rights” there may be disagreements about the meaning but the terms are accepted goods i sketched a simple teapot shape and enlarged it on the computer i used this as a template to make my card base once i had the shape cut out i added the striped sage paper at the top and bottom of the card i softened the edges with a little pale green blending chalk i used creative inspirations paint in winter frost and added a little detail to the edges with a paint brush the shimmer really added that little something extra to the card i gathered a piece of cream lace by hand and glued it to the card i attached a little garden twine over this to make it a little more secure also missed the memo that they would sound perfect and otherworldly third graders are not supposed to sound like that in third grade i learned to play hot cross buns on the recorder too often records made up of minimal components are misinterpreted as being gloomy but this is unlikely to be a fate which befalls kammerspiel given the sunlit glow which bathes its sounds opening song ‘maschines’ begins with a twinkling melody and builds gently like the breaking of the day culminating in kampman softly cooing “you are home” as the album progresses you come to see that the template of ‘maschines’ is in fact the blueprint for much of conquering animal sound’s work frequently their songs begin in timorous fashion gradually layering more and more sounds on top as they build let’s be clear though this isn’t to say that kammerspiel is in any way guilty of being formulaic because the band display a boundless creativity with the finer details throughout a little snippet of tape hiss here a dissonant hint of cello or a snatch of thicklydistorted vocal sample there meaning you’re never really fully aware of where they’re taking you at any point my suspicions turn to the iphone app i have been posting with lately i am staring at it all squinty

and i think that calls for a celebration and a blog post another salad i cannot have enough of them especially now that it's so hot outside and every monday i say to myself from today on i will be on a diet and i need to eat lots of salads with vitamins minerals and fibres only a collective and conscious movement of students around gscash can effectively strengthen it a movement that collectively ensures that woman students feel confident enough to report cases of sexual harassment and are not forced to retreat owing to mounting social pressures a conscious movement that rejects and resists the culture of slander flaunting of male machismo asking for sexual favours or harassing women in any form where women are not forced to constantly adjust their behaviour according to the male choices or diktats bodies and minds are not forced and tortured to adhere to beauty chastity housewife roles and rules – the prevalent feudal and consumerist morality we must recognize that atrocious incidents like the mms scandal has happened in our selfproclaimed progressive campus along with numerous other incidents of violence and harassment the rightwing forces whose politics flow solely from fascism and feudalism play a major role in maintaining the oppressive assaults of patriarchy and its crude manifestations in the campus too the blatant shielding of sexual harassers by various socalled ‘left’ organizations like sfi and aisa only strengthen the same reactionary regressive antiwoman statusquo a breeze stirred up rattling the leaves sounding almost like spoken words mellie

having some time out this weekend it is only may but i have witnessed the best film of and it is assassins the following review will contain nothing but fulsome praise for takashi miike’s film so brace yourselves… name givmocom however in order to be able to answer the question each week you do need some idea of what you’ve done which leads me to todays topicquestion do you keep track of what you do and if you do how do you keep track i don’t really have a single specific method that i use and i can’t avocate for any specific method for me i do have a few places where i can at least look and get an idea of what i’ve done so why don't you call in at the blog tomorrow we'd love you to join in the fun i'll also be showing you the details of my project for the challenge on here tomorrow

it falling down stairs that have no handrail hi honey where are you none of this film has a basis in reality not even emotional reality sure i get the doubledate conundrum but the resolution to this problem is so horribly patronising to all involved that the characters begin to fall to pieces well before the credits start rolling it defies logic how someone as smart as lauren does not realise there are two reconnaissance men literally running around her apartment while she’s dancing in her underwear and eating popcorn and to be so illadvised by her trashtalking friend trish throughout the entirety of this doubledating debacle the director and scriptwriter seemed to think that in order to make a woman sound empowered she had to act like a male character out of a farrelly brothers movie think ‘woogie’ from there’s something about mary trish is brash and crass and allround awful she has sex with her husband at the same time every week while eating some kind of cheetotype junk food and her punchlines are so soulcrushing that they actually made me want to throw things at her just to stop her giving all token comedic female characters a bad name although if anyone could name me one good comedic female sidekick i’ll watch the movie they’re in i would dearly love to write full time but i’m under no illusions about how hard this is to achieve you have to sell a lot of books on a

parents for a cookout fun was had by all ollie wasn't able to attend the cookout poor boy but looked very handsome in his patriotic bandana see below i personally was not very excited about all of the loud firework activity this year especially since rosie goes to be at grrrr all in all it was a great th throughout the week what little free time i had was spent focused on the spurs they closed the season on a game winning streak or in their last depending on how you want to look at things in fact if you subtract the two losses suffered on the road to portland and utah when coach gregg popovich sat tim duncan tony parker and manu ginobili the spurs could have finished the season on a tear the first playoff game sunday’s cruisecontrol victory over utah provided these delightful moments ginobili and ginobili do you still feel accepted peel and slice beets very thinly or use a mandoline tuesday menu tasting at the reception hall yum i couldn't see the look on my face but even i was terrified by me at one point andy and i were walking upstairs to get a shuttle and had to go through a one person door a woman cut me off by throwing her stupid fugly ass in the doorway without saying excuse me or apologizing and i finally let out a seriously seriously at her before launching into the most cussfilled rant i think i've ever made well define a pack order although dan clowes writes and draws all his own stories the real art of this piece is how the hell this middleaged man managed to nail the thoughts and characterisations of these two teenagers so well the dialogue is spoton and the relationship between the girls and their ‘friends’ is agonisingly real everyone goes through that awkward 'no longer a kid not yet an adult' phase and i guess that's why this book is so easy to relate to it's one of those stories where on the face of it little happens yet dig a little deeper and it's pretty much the whole of life wrapped up in eighty odd pages don rober began the bath by dipping the water out and pouring it right over me covering me head to toe with several waterfalls this may be the hot jungle but that river water is very cold – so cold and unexpected that i could not help but squeal loudly as i took huge breaths my heart racing don rober laughed and began his ministrations with smoking a mapacho of rustic tobacco and blowing the smoke into the crown of my head he began to whistle his icaro and pat me with the shacapa however i find it amusing how i already have gotten used to the pattern of sparks’ books now among his several books i’ve read before this was

currency or trade instead of money each smurf works for the betterment of the group and is named for what they do such as brainy smurf and farmer smurf the smurfs all wear the same white shorts and hat so that none can be considered an individual except for papa smurf referred to as the “father” of the clan not the leader who wears a red hat and red shorts seen as a wise figure he guides his

had my priesthood to live over again i would be a gentler with people the next time i would console more and challenge more carefully i was one of those people who was taught and who deeply believed that only the full truth can set us free that we owe it to people to challenge them with the truth in season and out i believed that and did it for most of the years of my ministry and i was a good priest i lived for others and never once betrayed in any real way my vows and my commitment but now that i am older i regret some of what i did i regret that sometimes i was too hard on people i meant it well i was sincere but i think that sometimes i ended up laying added burdens on people when they were already carrying enough pain if i were just beginning as a priest i would be gentler i would spend my energies more trying to lift pain from people people are in a lot of pain they need us first of all to help them with that” spicy potatoes with tomatoes from the gujarat region and as it

past what you must do is find the cause of suffering in the very moment of suffering by analyzing suffering you do not find the cause you analyze only the cause of a particular act then you say “i have understood the cause of that suffering” but in reality you have only learned to avoid the suffering you have not freed your mind from it this process of accumulation of learning through the analysis of a particular act does not give wisdom wisdom arises only when the “i” consciousness which is the creator the cause of suffering is dissolved am i making this difficult there’s dearest’s

cathy was volunteered to handle releases which she did of course with style and efficiency and hit the bar while the guys got the equipment cathy and i settled in at the corner of the bar with a glass of american pale ale and karnival kölsch respectively and started looking around for likely subjects for the shootand came up empty at first these were mostly folks who were just there for a couple beers and some dinner holder’s letter appeared to be part of an obama administration effort to respond more forcefully to the growing criticism over how the suspect was detained and questioned an

covers up how sharpwitted and powerful of an actor he truly is his performance in this otto preminger film is one of his finest but such a great film as this one of preminger's finest as well is already quite spectacular even without stewart but yeah he certainly makes it better many in the field of law have called this the most accurate look at a court trial ever put onto film but more

event and was very hopeful and excited that we would get to meet again and perhaps chat about my submission i was also thrilled to learn that i was placed in his manuscript critique group over the weekend i think one of the wisest decisions i made was to read from a new current work in progress so that he could see what else i had up my sleeve what this comes down to is a thorough reworking of the 'prolife' agenda to expand it and make it prodevelopment and prohealth with both of those being proactive concerns from the need to remove the horrors of abortion when the major excuses and reasons not to follow the scotus decision are removed and the decision enforced in full with the full regulatory authority of states and localities the issue of 'privacy' for those of the age of consent can be maintained while the custodial accountability particularly of courts stepping in with children against abusive parents in this venue can be sustained by putting the courts on hook for their decision about minors and families in the way of judges stepping in those judges then become accountable actors in the abortion situation and should be addressed and treated as such in their

and clichéd genres ever made some aren’t all bad like the everpopular lethal weapon the guilty pleasure rush hour series and my personal favorite hot fuzz the only differences between those movies and

of seven controversial fatal shootings in seven months in miami personal responsibility and charity as mentioned above being free also comes with responsibility you are free to fry your lung through cigars or cigarettes but don’t blame others when cancer comes knocking on your doors you see that is the beauty of a society that appeals to the individualistic tendencies of man for it allows man to make decisions on his own and face the harsh consequence of it people should be prepared to face whatever it is that comes with the decisions that they make they should never blame others nor expect sympathy or help from others but this is not to say that we humans should be selfish and refuse to help the needy which is why i am truly adhere to the idea of charity for this is an action that free individuals take free individuals help the needy not because someone state forces them to do it free individuals help others out of their own will they do it voluntarily isn’t it much more desirable when you give something to the needy when you do it out of your own free will and besides take this for example if i give my directly to the needy i’m pretty much sure that heshe will get it fully but if i give my pesos to a thirdparty state how can i be so sure that the thirdparty will give the full amount to the needy anyway this friday i reached the end of that story now the next chapter will

among other things he’s still doing great but with kindergarten coming up in the fall and some problems persisting even though j and i both felt he’d conquered those phases it seemed like a good idea to take another step towards making sure we looked into every possible avenue to keep him functioning at his best level in other words i had that sort of weird gnawing mommy sense that there was something else that needed to be done for my kid and i went skipping off to go find it unfortunately while i found the specialist who would help us with the fatty acids and the probiotics and so forth i also found that she wanted us to eliminate all gluten and casein from l’s diet this morning the buses stopped running i have heard tales that of the buses that were scheduled to be on routes this

speaking there is really no secret to lose weight eat properly and do proper exercise are the keys to lose weight and also are the keys to maintain what you have gained thereafter well it happened the thing that i've been dreading for almost four years happened yesterday on a lovely end of the summer evening with friends we had been invited to a barbeque at a nearby neighborhood swim club that our friends belong to it was friday of labor day weekend did we want to bring the kids over for a swim and a potluck dinner actually yes it is difficult for our family to socialize together with other families because of the joshua factor barbequing at a pool is a perfect setting to give it a try swimming is one of the things that all of our kids including josh love to do the adults might even get some conversation in over a glass of wine while grilling some bacon wrapped pork chops i think back with fond memories of my deluxeville days and all my single girl memories of living there i'm glad that i've always been the kind of gal to enjoy every moment of my life as it was happening i never understood people who couldn't be happy with what they had at the moment because they were to busy being sad thinking they needed something they didn't have to be happy i say enjoy every stage of your life even if it isn't exactly how you think it shouldwouldcould be there is no perfect lifethere is right here and right now so why waste it wishing for something else you never know what's going to happen tomorrow next week or next yearstop worrying so much and just enjoy what ya got omg there i

all and any critic of israel as though the fact that a lie was disseminated possibly by the idf in the first place in could offset the satellite images showing an attack that took place outside the territorial waters of israel this is part of a troubling trend of zios copycating holocaust denial techniques a single holocaust lie like that the nazis made soap from jews proves that the holocaust itself is a lie a single bogus holocaust survivor like binyamin wilkomirski proves that all survivors are impostors roll date fall i choose to have a brand new luxury car this year in christ jesus

in dignity and rights they are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood i think part of it has to do with our complete disengagement with

hatreds perhaps hoping that if we spew it from our bodies it will somehow heal us sort of like throwing trash on the ground get rid of it and it’s no longer my problem but it doesn’t heal it doesn’t

first looked deeper into marital psychology after his marriage ended in he thought the prevailing therapy of the time loosely termed ‘conflict resolution’ focused too much on compromise “what we found

like in the future years down the road another aspect of a news feature is the opportunity to present the writer’s opinion while this is dependent on the type of news feature and the type of readership the news feature offers the writer a chance to subtly voice his or her opinion in relation to the topic as the news feature includes more additional research and a larger picture it is more ethical for the writer to include their opinion using the ‘massacre in kandahar’ by jon lee anderson as an example again he subtly looks at the attitudes of soldiers suggesting a changing psychological view of killing he finishes off his story “war has a way of making all kinds of killings possible” while the piece is not overflowing with personal opinion similar to an opinion column

illustrations for pottermore but i’m ok with that the illustrations for pottermore look like paintings but they might be drawings – i haven’t been able to find out what they are yet and they’re

husband over nine years ago he liked baseball but he wasn’t obsessed with it now it’s a certifiable obsession my husband has the game on the television all the time and he wears his baseball glove

own pasta the pasta looked the right colour texture was good and when we fed it through the machine it seemed to make pretty good spaghetti the water was on the convection stove but was taking forever to boil we’d piled the spaghetti on the bench while we were waiting and when we went to get it…it had melted into each other the pasta machine had also decided that our softening pasta was not going

good restaurant called frattellos it was right on the river and had a huge outdoor bar and party area with tons of boat slips it made me think about how much fun it probably is in the summertime i guess they have live music out there a few times a week too saturday we atteneded an egg hunt at the park near our house there were were a ton of people and not really enough eggs it was actually kind of chaotic and made me never want to attend another one hah the easter bunny was walking around the grounds so there were hoards of people surrounding him at all times with no real lines to stand it to actually get a picture with him or anything oh well debuting under sm entertainment one of the country’s best entertainment management companies is known to be a difficult task they went through from one to seven years of preparation before debuting they can’t ignore the amount of harsh training they went through but the competition between the company’s trainees was of course really intense

there's one in the city my bf lives in so hopefully we can try it out soon lilly is the real star of the movie and anjelica huston is brilliant presenting a natural predator who doesn't even realize her nature she's like a shark in that she doesn't ponder her actions but has to keep moving or drown she has been a grifter her whole life and working for bobo has found a golden opportunity with access to easy money and regular employment while she continues to steal money bobo even expects her to steal as she shows when she recites his speech back to him if he's not stealing a little he's stealing a lot of course the difference between a little and a lot is ambiguous especially over time much relies on the appearance of order and when bobo is tipped off he has no choice to take action even though her actions could well have been well within what was expected of her that's the hazard of having a boss although the premise of working for someone would seem to be part of her grift the fact that lilly would work her grift on someone as dangerous as bobo shows her dedication to the lifestyle her quick turnaround of myra's murder attempt shows that she's the ultimate opportunist quick

haven’t heard in quite a while it’s an old one from the seventies called “cosmic cowboy” by barry mcguire now i must explain that barry’s music has a special place in my heart because he along with many other pioneers of contemporary christian music came to the lord in the late sixties and early seventies that’s when my wife and i came to christ through a genuine move of god called “the jesus people movement” young people in and out of the hippie movement were coming to the lord at that time in droves and were experiencing much freedom in christ and spontaneous organic church life david lynch is no stranger to horror though his movies may not be seen as typical horror or typical anything for that matter he definitely knows how to craft a nightmare scenario it’s hard to explain why

female congregation particularly young girls making it his mission to deflower them and his view of women as repositories for his lust guilt and total disregard for women as anything other than objects makes him a truly horrific character in a way perhaps only a man of the cloth can teagardin gets off on his guilt finding that it is just this feeling that intensifies his connection to god

rensburg who with four other farmers owned a ha property called kafferskraal on his ha portion he produced tons of mealies per annum and as much meat needed to feed people a land claim on these farms was completed in july in september the farmers left and there has been no movement on the farms since then except that one of the previous owners is renting his particular property back no business plans were produced although mr van rensburg said he’d help the new owners gerd gastroesomethingidon'tfeellikespellingout reflux disease technically he's been diagnosed with this twice the first time he was held down while a scope was inserted up his nose and down his throat so much fun and they concluded that since they saw nothing he must have reflux i was still working on my honorary doctorate at this point and therefore did not make the connection between we found nothing and reflux however despite this he was put on a medication for it which he promptly threw up over and over again he was then put on another medication which cost us not only an arm and a leg but fingers and toes too after no obvious improvement he was taken off the medicine fast forward a few weeks we held him down as they inserted another scope up his nose and down his throat which he hated just as much as the first time except at that point his esophagus is inflammed meaning he has silent reflux bad news silent reflux is worse because instead of spewing it out he swallows it back down allowing the acid to burn his throat twice good news less puke stains on my shirt back onto the ridiculously expensive

so many times when we had visitors all of the affliction that each of us endure is different yet the same result comes as we make the best of our circumstances we learn and grow i want you to focus on the bad things that happen repeatedly in your life those things that seem to constantly happen over and over again and it’s annoying it got me thinking – why wait i expect that several of my varieties

just haunted by jon pertwee but haunted by a pertwee story that doesn’t exist this is not the first reference to an unseen adventure ever of course but it is in many ways the most substantive and deliberate there’s stuff like planet from the invasion but that can be explained away as a continuity goof and there’s stuff like the terrible zodin but that’s clearly intended as a joke and there’s stuff like meglos but that story suggests a visit that was more tourismbased the only story to really resemble this is the face of evil and even there the story hinged specifically on the unseen story being a tom baker adventure i cut the the main image with the circle stax dienamics and then used my red multiliner copic pen to draw in the threads of the baseball colored up the main image with my

tormented him for three straight years as the baby jesus the nurses at st mary's were amazing everyone was so helpful and accommodating all of the nurses were genuinely excited for us they even got us a room so i could stay with the baby it was a very special time italian seasoning please make sure it goes back in the plastic bag so they dont get damaged in weather then on sunday i had the day from hell it involved a certain new fella in my life buddy and poo i shall leave it to your imagination but the poor lamb ha has probably eaten some teddy fur which has caused some diverse effects but the day started off with me having a coffee in bed brought to me by my thoughtful husband but because just going out had tired me out i fell to sleep sat up in bed with the coffee in my hand which i tend to rest on my chest and hold with my chin that woke me up and thankfully it wasn't piping hot but i have scolded me in the past because i fall back to sleep easily something to do with fm and having so much medication that makes me drowsy oh says it's almost like i've got narcolepsy but not quite so severe stepped in the dirt made something good from it fall out of favour while i’m having a lovely time seeing friends and family again there’s absolutely no doubt that paul is the one who’s enjoying this holiday more than anybody mostly because he’s being treated as an equal by everybody and given the chance to prove himself capable in fact i think this is probably his best holiday for a very very long time i have to admit that i was a bit apprehensive about bringing him with me because what with my disability and his we're a bit like the blind leading the blind at times but he hadn't been back since we left to move back to the uk twelve years ago so it was only fair he came too i'm glad he did sometimes you just have to throw yourself into a situation and hope for the best when news of any of this hits the media there is usually some uncomfortable wordsmithing by federal representatives and occassionally a promise to apologize at some point in time in the future always in the future yet treating us like domestic terrorists and spying on us continues don't bother making more empty promises just admit you are at war with us and let the chips fall where they may if you are going to be our enemy have the backbone to admit it i first heard the name john demjanjuk

others for their own failures here's the photograph i'm currently writing a tutorial for although i was on the edge of my seat for cassia and ky to find each other the book as a whole did seem somehow bland the characters travel around quite a bit and undergo some introspection but a curious lack of tension and foreboding meant the plot suffers as a result there’s also a nagging sense of familiarity if matched felt like the giver crossed feels like the obernewtyn series by isobelle carmody and if you were even slightly prepared for this stage knowing that the pulling and stretching was coming you forgot that you too were part of the dance that the relationship was going to be stretched by both of you again i love the sound of this one it just feels right after opening it i

her rocking her taking in her sounds her scents and her size everywhere is war if it be contended that the work of god is progressing and that we are growing in holiness then some perplexing questions arise which will be hard to answer if the church is making advances on the lines of deep spirituality—if we are a praying people noted for our prayer habits—if our people are hungering after holiness—then let us ask why do we now have so few mighty outpourings of the holy spirit on our chief churches and our principal appointments why is it that so few of our revivals spring from the life of the pastor who is noted for his deep spirituality or the life of our church is the lord’s hand shortened that he cannot save is his ear heavy that he cannot hear why is it that in order to have socalled revivals we must have outside pressure by the reputation and sensation of some renowned evangelist this is largely true in our larger charges and with our leading men why is it that the pastor is not sufficiently spiritual holy and in communion with god that he cannot hold his own revival services and have large outpourings of the holy spirit on the church the community and upon himself there can be but one solution for all this state of things we have cultivated other things to the neglect of the work of holiness we have permitted our minds to be preoccupied with material things in the church unfortunately whether designedly or not we have substituted the external for the internal we have put that which is seen to the front and shut out that which is unseen it is all too true as to the church that we are much further advanced in material matters than in matters spiritual em bounds the essentials of prayer be a wizard or a vampire carlos ferraz is regularly in

told us about it i found this book for at a flea market love maps and an idea started to form the dogs scared the hell out of me when i was younger in fact that may be a deep psychological reason why i didn't like dogs then makes you think and what about that financial insecurity this is another dreaded thing i hear about from clients friends and of course all over the news how can financial insecurity possibly be a good thing again as shakespeare’s hamlet said “…there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so” what did i learn from radical financial insecurity that my true

peek now open for submissions from arab or international publishing houses that publish arabiclanguage books for children ages “do you walk down this path often” derrek tugged at the fabric of his jacket letting it breathe we are accidents of chance first of all there’s a big change in the setting the previous book took place in the slick futuristic society while crossed is more of a survival story in the rugged desert the landscape is harsh and unforgiving yet cassia and ky both find a certain kind of beauty in it i feel this sums the book up as a whole dystopian fiction is dark by nature with the characters often finding themselves in terrible situations crossed is appropriately serious as the characters face the concept of death and inner demons yet they always choose to hope instead

i'm also super pleased to be getting a nice pay raise now i am a woman so i can't guarantee that once we start the project i won't change my mind at least times but at least with this little exercise i can see what i'm drawn to and what elements are musthaves 'i don't know' the last and logical question that one will naturally ask is has the emergency resulting from the war passed or does it still exist this is a fair and decisive question inasmuch as the existence of the emergency is my opinion the test and the only basis of the operation or cessation of act the existence or nonexistence of the emergency resulting from the war is a question of fact it is based on conditions obtaining among the people and in the country and perhaps even near and around it it is highly controversial question on which people may honestly differ there are those who in all good faith believe and claim that conditions have returned to normal that the people have now enough to eat sometimes even more than they had before the war that people nowadays especially in the cities are better nourished and clothed and transported and better compensated for their labor and that the president himself in his speeches chats and messages had assured the public that normal times have returned that the problem of peace and order had been solved that the finances of the government and the national economy are sound and that there is an adequate food supply it is therefore claimed that there is no longer any emergency resulting from the war tears rolled down her cheeks and a chill swept in constant waves over her skin stealing her strength she shook her head again and begged the man not to hurt her but the other man’s hand over her mouth turned her words into nothing more than a frightened murmur

remember how the epa said it was safe for new yorkers to return to the area around ground zero despite the obvious hazard to respiration from asbestos dust the government’s action around the bp oil geyser is equally negligent and harmful to humans my friend kyle noted recently that if radiation had caused these deformities there’d be a lot more outrage given the media silence on radioactive seawater spreading out from japan i’m not so sure the new season on bbc as the months passed i had an inkling that john maybe had hiv there were weird happenings which i couldn't explain through junk logic like how i'd arrange to lend him money until he got his government payment and on the areed day i'd turn up at his hostel with the cash only to be told he was in hospital a week later he'd turn back up clean of crack and heroin and give me some fanny about a muscle problem or a lung infection i never doubted the reasons he gave just the way he shrugged them off as if they were everyday and nothing serious but i knew it was serious anything that would have a junkie laid up in hospital half sick is very serious god i've seen addicts with limbs hanging off through gangrene who wouldn't go to hospital for fear of not getting out the same evening and being sick or subdued with inadequate amounts of methadone so for john to be in hospital on the day he was to get money was bizarre when it kept happening i marked him down as one of the many 'closeted' hiv'ers on the injecting dope scene john never did tell me and so it was only ever speculation fool can do love itself is what is left over when being in love has a year later i think it's fair to say that ruby's transition to a pampered life with a pair of besotted humans has gone smoothly she remains a quiet girl who rarely barks and only occasionally whines moose sometimes supposes this behavior is a result of neglect and isolation in her early life poor ruby never learned she could use her voice to command humans and order her world that of course is one reason we've heard relatively little from her here on the blog in other respects though ruby is remarkably transformed from the skinny critter she was a year ago daily exercise and a better diet have bulked her up considerably her paw pads which were soft as a baby's behind when she arrived in roxie's world are now thick with callouses she enjoys walks but the concept of play is still something of a mystery to her unlike me she won't hang out in the yard by herself for extended periods of time chasing squirrels digging holes and woofing at anything that moves in the company of a human however she will race from one end of the ridiculously large backyard to the other in crazy figure s moose is trying to capture this delightful activity on film for the

you about this subject believe me it is one of the deepest importance this is no mere question of controversy this is not one of those points on which men may agree to differ and feel that differences will not shut them out of heaven a man must be right on this subject or he is lost forever heaven or hell happiness or misery life or death blessing or cursing in the last day—all hinges on the answer to this question “what do you think about the cross of christ” but here we are scarily six decades on dear reader and i have rediscovered a particular favourite from that era of course i never remembered its name at the time but on watching it again the dim and distant memories started seeping back if you have noticed i don't blog too much so just consider this i haven't been out much visiting places to save money for my trip however i plan to get back in the swing of things after my vacation of course i will post about the fun times i will have in florida and dc for you guys i

title and it made sense to me why the big show cried when he won the title at wrestlemania on one hand he finally won solo at wrestlemania on another he became a grand slam champion there were only six more that could do it before he accomplished the feat dusk was beginning to settle birds flew home for the night a brilliant red sky lighting their way a low growl resonated from the end of a row

wars shoes and they light up nolan has been having a blast lighting them up at daycare he and his friend gavin ran around saying 'one two three lightup' and they would jump to get them to lightup the only rule i had for daddy and nolan when they went to buy shoes before was no lightup shoes and this time i'm with them and without thinking i told nolan he could have starwars shoes so now he has lightup shoes we'll see how long the lights keep flashing and because he got star wars shoes daddy and nolan had to watch the star wars clone wars cartoon so he would know that his shoes were supposed to look like storm troopers everything happens for a reason this isn’t always fun to live through but hell if ain’t gonna make me stronger i will not wait for someone to unlock me from this cage and

been wanting to do this forever i think it is important that one gets credit for their creations without it it is possible for anyone to claim they made something that was actually a creation of someone else i am not sure how often this happens but i am sure it does i have tried to figure out how before with different editing software with no luck i am not that computer savvy when it comes to things like this a couple of days ago i saw on pinterest a howto from a site called picmonkey oh my goodness it is so easy and it works and it doesn't cost anything if you are interested in a tutorial let me know or go to my pinterest boards link on right side of my blog and go to my papercrafting board and you can check out her tutorial too cool and i will spend more time during sleep our brain

agree with that statement moreover during the administration of president richard brodhead the university’s most significant raciallyoriented episode involved not racism toward africanamerican students or professors but a raciallycharged crusade directed by members of the school’s africanamerican studies department against a group of falsely accused white duke students apart from a single statement from provost peter lange rebuking an outright racist screed from thenduke professor houston baker—and a vague tardy and ultimately toothless apology from brodhead—there’s no evidence that anyone from duke’s administration ever addressed this faculty behavior or ever rebuked those duke professors whose private biases led them to ignore their obligations to their own institution’s

were completely baffled by their daughter’s suicide attempt and wondered what they were doing wrong after she came home from the hospital her parents decided to take her psychiatrist’s advice and throw her a “welcome home” party inviting all of her friends down into the basement for a boygirl party this must have been extremely uncomfortable for cecilia as she usually was very socially introverted and didn’t know how to handle the attention quietly she asks her mother if she can be excused to go upstairs as she can feel all eyes on her wrists and not at all on her her mother taken aback by this odd request sadly excuses her daughter telling her that she invited everyone over so she didn’t have to feel alone cecilia acknowledges this but is unable to stay quietly she excuses

reached down to where the floor met that wall he cupped his fingers and scraped at the floor and wall until he had made a hole going in sideways he stood leaped against the wall while reaching up but

again and again it caught on something temporarily when the people saw the thunder and lightning and heard the trumpet and saw the mountain in smoke they trembled with fear they stayed at a distance and said to moses “speak to us yourself and we will listen but do not have god speak to us or we will die” exodus – frankly many christians are way more comfortable with a god who is easygoing calming and smells like daffodils than we are with the god who thunders commands and smells like smoke we sing songs that say “in his presence there is comfort…” and “i can hear the brush of angel’s wings” because “surely the presence of the lord is in this place” and there is nothing wrong with those songs we do come into god’s presence with “confidence to enter the most holy place by the blood of jesus by a new and living way opened for us through the curtain that is his body” heb but while jesus provides the way into god’s presence we must remember that god is the same god that shook the

golden tresses sometimes i wish somebody would take me by the hand…and honestly just hold it… disc features a good two minutes of audience activity before the wellreceived encore “echoes” is introduced for the most part this is a very good albeit standard performance of the epic but it’s worth noting that this rendition includes dick parry’s sax solos that would be commonplace throughout the dates and though i have mixed feelings about these improvs i think they’re pretty successful on this occasion the highlight of this rendition of “echoes” is most certainly the fabulous synth solo beginning at the mark which makes a great transition to gilmour’s lead break during the triplet section a fine conclusion for a great concert that is absolutely worth owning what tools have you found to be successful in keeping alumni engaged what tools do you wish you had as i have wrote so mote it be continuing with my series on what the passion narrative can teach us about international

overlooking the harvest gardens looks like a quilt doesn't it that is what they are trying to duplicate i've recently happened upon some advice that selfpublishers need to stop blogging about selfpublishing and instead have an author's blog guilty as charged but not for long check out my new blog at wwwharmonylitwordpresscom plans for this blog include weekly short story fiction posts featuring characters from the akasha series sample reads guest author posts resources for readers and of course plenty of polls contests and giveaways one example i can come up with is during a conversation about people trying weird fantasy and a person commented that he wanted to give it a try but didn’t think he would do it very well… so he just stuck with standard fantasy fare burt's bees but how can that be what you know you can't explain but you feel it i'll be back sunday night but will try to blog any worthy goofy happenings while i am there by ian young there are many types of bullying including racial bullying sexual bullying and cyber bullying bullying includes name calling saying or writing derogatory comments purposely excluding an individual from activities spreading lies and rumors ignoring threatening doing anything to make another person feel uncomfortable or scared stealing or damaging belongings of others kicking hitting slapping and making someone do things they do not want to do there is not much that is more cozy than a cat sleeping on a pretty quilt in the sun the surgery was scheduled for the next monday which being a friday at the time was all too

rogue left hand dogfish founders and too many others to enumerate here regarding our designers i love the herald sun and it loves me as can be seen by all the recipes it gives me for foods i don't eat from cooking shows i don't watch and the articles it shows me about people i neither know nor care about doing things i have never heard about before with other people i know even less about since i don't care much what happens in the rest of the world anyway it really is the paper for me on this sunday in particular the family and i went to an animal rescue center in addition to an ark’s worth of animals that we saw and honestly one day i will post a plethora of pictures from that visit there was one particular monkey that stole the show for us sage is the smallest of the three and seems to be the most delicately built she was pretty frightened of us when she first arrived but took a different approach than spice instead of straining against her rope and trying to escape sage would just

and tapered raglan sleeves the movie was exceptionally fun and even though there were very dark and exciting moments it was also a very realistic portrayal of just being a bored teenager and needing a way to channel all your excess emotions into something new and different i really liked the actor that played andrew dane dehaan who kind of resembles a perpetually stoned and sickly looking leonardo dicaprio circa gilbert grape i doubt those were her exact words but you get the gist oh well won't be long and with daily mowing we hopefully will kill it off i'd say it's rapidly catching up though and the experimental stuff like the hibiscus amber at dieu de ciel is equivalent to the stuff american brewers are doing with its own direction canadian brewers and particularly quebecois brewers explore things with less fear of having the results labeled as girly beers and i think that's a very good thing there seemed to be less of the embrace of the extreme beer which i also think is a good thing the report draws on more than data sources to test progress on the government’s “three pillars” of the big society enabling people to shape their local area opening up public services provision

here’s the story my wife annie flew down to meet me in houston in early april – about the time passover was starting my idea was we’d have a second honeymoon as we meandered our way up to minnesota in our ’ airstream globe trotter we’d arrive at the airstream dealer in st louis mo to trade up to a newer airstream my retired friends jane and elwood who live in their airstream full time traded the

alliance which represents advertising networks and associations so what’s the verdict for my part i would much rather have kids read the hunger games than twilight or any of the comparably cringeworthy ‘teen fiction’ out there is it writing worthy of the frenzy it’s created probably not but it’s a heck of a lot better than what kids could be reading if i had my choice i’d have them reading harry potter and then moving onward and upward to things like the lord of the rings or dickens or dracula if you want a real vampire story but not every kid is like i was and even a read as easy as the hunger games will get their creative juices going macy and huffman have two oscar nominations two emmy wins and seven globe nominations between them like an evil blind hags she pours this

specific circumstances after a hour waiting period and only after state mandated counseling while these state mandated stipulations are not as severe as some found in other states they still pose a challenge to many foundations of women’s rights and women’s health as of january a woman must receive statedirected counseling that includes information that is designed to discourage her from having an abortion this information must be provided in person at the clinic hours before a woman is allowed to obtain the procedure the pamphlets and packets that is provided include diagrams of what the fetus looks like at its various stages and describes in detail the various organ functions developing at different states before the woman is provided with these detailed handouts she is required to watch the ultra sound of the fetus as the doctor describes it in detail the doctor is then required to look for a heartbeat in the fetus and play it for the woman if it is found after all of these proceedings take place the woman must wait at least hours before she can actually have the abortion preformed this is just a quick post a few sneak peaks of what i've been working on to be nobody but

job i’ve had for the last months there is a lot to do and there is no way i can do everything in the official number of hours per week in addition to this no procedures are written and it’s a real

habits of work no clear view of who is in charge of what for many things and we have a hard time building consistent actions together to add some spice to it interns change often come for week months

discuss the craft of writing for children in his love oh he continues he's put his glasses on and no it doesn't make him look any less boring the key to the crunchy crisp skin is this secret ingredientscorn starch what a valuable lesson i have learned from the living magazine this is such a simple roast chicken that anyone can prepare all you need to do is to wash and clean the whole chicken believe it or not this is a task that i took a while to pick up the courage to do pat it real dry inside out and rub some butter all over the skin including under the skin butter will help the chicken to brown evenly the next thing is to rub a combination of salt pepper and corn starch all over the chicken including the cavity and of course under the skin to add flavour to the meat i like to add in some dried mixed herbs as i love the smell of the herbs when the chicken is roasting it is perfectly all right to leave it out or you could do with some fresh rosemary finely chopped i don't truss the chicken as i don't know how to do it plus i think it is not an absolute must the last step is to place it in a roasting pan preferably one that comes with a rack to encourage even browning and leave it to the oven to the finish the job as it is not necessary to baste the chicken in about an hour's time you will be rewarded with a golden crispy chicken not forgetting the inviting aroma of the roast chickeni feel so proud for myself as i am very certain my neighbours could smell it and would probably think their neighbour must be a good cook lucifer’s friend went on to make a few more albums but changed their style quite a bit from the debut which is where night sun comes in another german band with a high pitched screamer and pounding organist this sounds like it should have been the second album from lucifer’s friend their debut album mournin’ from has been described as lucifer’s cousin or lucifer’s friend that came with the other guy god could have deemed otherwise in god’s plan jesus was offered wine for his throat so why not a towel for his face simon carried the cross of jesus but he didn’t mop the cheek of jesus angels were a prayer away couldn’t they have taken the spittle away these thoughts are never over they aren’t it is a thought that is continuous unfortunately and all we can ever ask for is a change of weather “don’t talk to me like a little baby mom is still in this house” do things to try to encourage them for example i had a friend in high school from the sudan and there wasn’t anyone else on campus who was from the sudan so i took him with me to the mission a couple times he got to hang out with some of the sudanese there speak his language talk about his past with people who actually understood it etc and it was a great time for him he thanked me multiple times for taking him with so look for ways that you might encourage a refugee life in a new country is never easy and little things often mean a tremendous amount purely mentally move the clocks hands forward to hasten the time i'm not a spokesman for it but you can see it in action with martha stewart in the driver's seat what i really like is how easy it is to clean

technical high having somebody i knew going to the school including a boy i had been to tea with several times overrode the opinions of my parents that a grammar school would be better for me of course the grammar would have been more suitable but all i could see at the grammar was nobody i knew and lots of girls i am thrilled to share with you the steps to create a fun and zany hallowe'en in wonderland inspired mobile as shared on the graphic blog a few days ago as soon as i saw the new line by graphic this project popped into my head i immediately thought of the movie scene where all of

coming to the end of a challenging week… i don’t know what it is but sometimes i just seem to find it tough to fit it all in in terms of food i’ve been right on track but when it comes to my usual workout routine… i’ve been off the pace a bit maybe that’s how it should be though… when things are too routine it’s not always a good thing i played hockey last sunday did an hour of yoga on monday played hockey again tuesday rode my spin bike for over an hour wednesday played more hockey thursday which was intense with only sub and took yesterday off well other than my consecutive chin ups and a second attempt to duplicate the demonstration which only made it to number … at the end of my shift at work is not when i’m at my optimal in terms of performance it seems first thing in the morning seems best i guess looking back my week wasn’t a loss… just different i can't speak for koch's previous work but there's also a ton of action and adventure in alexander outland earlier in this review i used the word cinematic to describe the novel and it's apt as i tried to consider what other novels might compare favorably to it only films came to mind spaceballs serenity the ice pirates and galaxy quest plenty of explosions daring rescues and space battles dot the narrative for all that and the romance angle mentioned above this is a novel of humor and it is genuinely funny gj koch brings it home after i thought i was done i decided to make the envelope cute as well the edges were distressed with peeled paint and a little faded jeans i found an extra alligator leftover from the card so i adhered it to the envelope and added some more stickles for the eyes it only took a couple of minutes to make the envelope and i think it adds so much to the finished project i hope my nephew likes it i try not to think deep thoughts early in the morning generally just finding shoes that match can totally make me happy but every once in a while i find myself reflecting on life in general and how it can change seemingly in an instant every day i struggle with paying attention to the here and now lofty ambitions and longterm plans have their place but there’s also something invaluable in the simplest pastimes a long walk in the evening organizing that junk drawer playing catch with the grandchildren baking a batch of cookies sending everyone lots of love out there in honor of valentine's day have any big plans my man and i will be having a mellow evening in tonight although we already sort of celebrated on sunday by going to a swell season concert at a teeny venue this was our th time seeing them live i'll admit it we're groupies and proud as always when seeing glen marketa perform it was magic whatever is a pretty inclusive word whatever you do…whatever you say do all in the name of the lord jesus many times i felt that i had reached my limit that i would lose my mind if i did not escape from my situation i ran away from one orphanage with my roommate crystal one night when i was around eleven years old and we wandered through the woods to a dirt road we walked to the home of lillie mae white the cook for the orphanage when we knocked on her door and she saw who we were she drew a deep breath of dismay she was plump little black lady with small round spectacles and she never seemed to be without an apron and a hairnet on she asked me how i knew where she lived and i still don’t remember how i knew unless i just looked in the phone book or something she was a kind woman and was obviously concerned about us and knew that we came there because we trusted her she gave us a warm homecooked meal as we sat out on her porch and her relatives came and went from the house as we visited they seemed to be such a closeknit family something

living from honey fitz and hadn't been back to that original post and seen those comments the point is if you want people to accept the incest you have to give them more of a reason for siblings to have sex than simply because they wanted it people want lots of things that are not acceptable but that does not make the thing acceptable to lots of people as always with writing you need to figure out what your motive is for writing the scene before you can figure out your characters’ motivations are you trying to prove that sibling love is acceptable that it’s inevitable under certain circumstances that love is love wherever you find it that you have the hots for your sister or brother and want society’s okay whatever you want to prove you then have to write the scene with this objective in mind today’s list of stuff includes – digging sowing lots of seeds planting tomatoes out well some of them crossing fingers buying buttons and cat litter and possibly writing a long

symbiotic relationship with powerful sources of information by economic necessity and reciprocity of interest the media need a steady reliable flow of the raw material of news they have daily news demands and imperative news schedules that they must meet they cannot afford to have reporters and cameras at all places where important stories may break economics dictates that they concentrate their resources where significant news often occurs where important rumors and leaks abound and where regular press conferences are held the white house the pentagon and the state department in washington dc are central nodes of such news activity on a local basis city hall and the police department are the subject of regular news “beats” for reporters business corporations and trade groups are also regular and credible purveyors of stories deemed newsworthy these bureaucracies turn out a large volume of material that meets the demands of news organizations for reliable scheduled flows

my opinion dairy is not good for you cow’s milk is intended to make a baby calf into a lb cow sooo… yeah in my opinion meat is not good for you it may be the only source of vit b however taking it in

withhold if we say you can only have one cookie we have just given the cookie greater value than the green beans we pile on their plate in our house we have lifted all controls on food if you have had strict controls on food you can expect that your children will react to that as soon as the strict controls are lifted we have found that our children still approach food from a place of lack as soon as they suspect that there might be a limited quantity of any particular food item for example our girls love microwaveable asian soup bowls from trader joe's when we first started buying them there was a great deal of concern about who had eaten how many and how many were still in the pantry when i assured the girls that there were plenty and we could always go to the store to buy more they did not instantly trust that this was true they were still responding from a place of lack when i started buying huge numbers of soup bowls at a time this helped some however what has helped the most is months and months of making sure that we always buy soup bowls so that they girls can build up the trust required to let go of their feels of lack special features not available entertainment one this

post a dual review of edgar wright's scott pilgrim vs the world and todd solondz's life during wartime just before i headed out with my family to yellowstonegrand teton but the review took longer than i hoped and i decided against working on it during my vacation—'cause you know it's a vacation after all so if you didn't realize it already i am a classy girl just ask my niece can you share a few of

with whipped cream about a month ago i was at the doctor with the hubs as i was sitting in the waiting room i noticed a new mother and her baby the baby was adorable as all babies are and the new mom was in awe with her little bundle after a while we began chatting you know the normal your baby is too cute conversation at some point she shared with me that the baby had spent a couple of months in the nicu due to being diagnosed with meningitis soon after birth naturally i told her about footprints ministry after a few minutes into our conversation it was obvious she was in need so as she and her mother the baby's grandmother were leaving i gave her my contact information and told her to please let me know if i could do anything to help her i remember driving michael around on a tour of area breweries a day that turned into a travel disaster he was two and a half hours late leaving new york thanks to some skinny git who was trying and never did open a brewpub in nyc but still managed to hold mj's attention all morning i suspect he simply refused to take him to tony forder's house until he'd said all he had to say we had to cancel the appointment at yards and drive on to brandywine brewing near wilmington in heavy rain yay one of the friends is one that i have known since high school for a few years we were inseparable her parents were like a second set of parents to me we grow apart our senior year…which sucks now but we were both immature about things and our friendship ended i am sorry that it ended but i know that’s part of life what the mail has done is present the figures so as to make the ballot sound as close and unfair as possible in order to fit with its own political agenda had they reported the ballot fairly they would have been forced to acknowledge that support for a strike in the five businesses concerned was solid the full results of the ballots can be found in the links to the pdf documents at the bottom of this press release those results show that in three of the five ballots the total voting ‘yes’ was more than of those entitled to vote if you were to amalgamate the votes in the ballots that supported the strike you shouldn’t of course but just for fun you’d find that the results were as follows becky and ashley hayes bridge road but the night is bright and cheery baby wolf coos should bible study and vegas be in the same sentence

it's safe to say i'm not a vegas kind of girl although the confederates seemed to be emerging as victors of the battle a minor mishap and grant’s stubborn refusal to crumble under in defeat led to an eventual victory for the union around pm general johnston was leading a charge against a union camp near a peach orchard when he took a bullet behind his right knee johnston did not believe the wound was serious at the time and instead sent his personal physician to tend some captured wounded union soldiers although he did not feel anything the bullet possibly fired by friendly fire had in fact clipped a part of his popliteal artery within minutes his boot filled up with blood and johnston’s staff saw that he was on the verge of fainting it did not take long before he finally died and

like it was straight up and she was not sure she would make it and coming down looked scary so she did not even make it to the chain railing the constitutive theory sets out that it is the recognition of an entity as a state that makes it so this theory would explain why “transnistria” and other similarly situated entities are not considered to be states this theory however fails to explain why certain entities that have received numerous recognitions as such are not in fact states it also raises the question of how many recognitions are necessary in order for an entity to become a state one clear example of this problem is the “state of palestine” as of july the palestinian liberation organization plo was reporting that it had received at least recognitions of its “statehood” to put things in perspective there are currently members of the un that means over half of the united nations recognizes palestine as a state however not even the plo’s negotiator’s website discusses palestine as if it were already a state one simple reason for this might be that states serve a regulatory function in the world their function is to administer a portion of the planet where people live if they cannot serve that function because they lack authority over a territory or people on the territory no matter what you call them they are not states this is the case of palestine it has no effective control of which to speak and therefore cannot even with recognition be a new state the constitutive theory like the declaratory theory therefore would seem to provide little useful information standing alone on whether an entity is or is not a state we learned about ike the horse's first home the “existentials” need to find better ways to aim for and reach the moving target of

engineering it is getting too late to do justice to the it’s one of those strange facts about the internet particularly when there is perceived anonymity that people start to do things that they would almost certainly never do in real life a sort of groupthink takes over and people become vicious and nasty they bully a magnifying glass is held up to the darker elements of their personality and they start saying and doing things that offline they wouldn’t normally – or would to a lesser extent which is where the anonymous saying comes from with the numerous friends who adore my company the band

pathetic that the ancient toys in the film scared me more than the woman herself it's embarrassing to admit but toy monkeys playing maracas and cymbals are a thousand times creepier than any ghost

the bakongo called musoni this is why our ancestors met clandestine in the cabins fields etc and did the ring shout because through the ecstatic dance they could recreate themselves in the foreign land they found themselves in through dance and trance one is able to communicate with the spirits and get fresh new ideas and create success this in my opinion is how kamitic success was truly created he lay on top of her she spasmed as the pins pressed in further with his weight but it wasn’t enough he ran his fingers up the sides of her rib cage and pushed his chest against hers there seems to be two thoughts about writing erotica one that the story should hold together even if there wasn’t any sex and two that the sex must be such an integral part of the story that it will fall apart without the sex i subscribe to the second theory because it holds true for any sex scene — it must be a scene rather than simply a depiction of sex this means the scene must advance the story tell us more about the characters show us how having sex changed the hero or show a change in the relationship between the participants so many authors seem to have the attitude that they need to arbitrarily insert a sex scene into the story but such scenes need to be written in response to the demands of the story not just because “it’s time to insert a sex scene” laws of life in christ jesus

and roop – who has a bit of a thing for big hair becky – is very keen for her to get off politicians in perak must also be aware that they are subject to the people’s will and it is almost certain the bn reps will feel the full wrath of perak’s voters during the next election the small tactical advantage gained by overthrowing perak’s elected government is likely to increase the anger of voters

hours later we were sliding back and forth on a road i remembered traveling the previous summer even in the warmth of june and with dry dirt the road had scared me i had actually ducked my head down just to not look out the window during that drive because i’d been so scared now in the dead of winter and knowing we were now sliding back and forth and that same road i was doing the death grip on the back of my mother’s seat in the bronco to everyone else in the vehicle it had been a good time never mind that the roads we were riding on had cliffs reminiscent of an indiana jones movie as we continued driving further ascending higher and encountering deeper snow the mood in the vehicle quickly changed from jovial to tense finally my uncle driving his bronco gave into the pleadings of my good aunt who seemed just as nervous now as i did upon reaching a small clearing and wide spot my uncle quickly turned the bronco around and we began our descent down the mountain pass i want to dissipate all of my sorrows now of course rousseau is a misogynist indeed the words ‘woman’ or ‘women’ appear only three times in the whole book – once in the phrase “excluding foreigners women children or slaves” and the other two times in commenting on relative fecundity in different climates i made sacks for lexy and avree to open each hour with hats horns etc in them conditions can make you quiet copic xpress paper those of us with celiac disease must become vigilant reading every label like a true detective kitchens must be scoured for sticky gluten residue lingering on cutting

scary there are two jars of vegenaise in our refrigerator now one has mom’s gf written in marker across the lid when my sons still lived with us and we sported a mixed kitchen they had their own designated gluten cupboard for their favorite breakfast cereals snacks and sandwich bread the rest of the pantry was labeled the glutenfree zone as an aside colson whitehead doesn't seem to share duncan's insulting and condescending attitudes he recently admonished literary purists asking why he would write genre fiction don't be such a snob so we should try not to hold duncan's deplorable review against whitehead i am the person who observes the world as it passes along my passengers who passed their gems of knowledge to me i give thanks can you name that tune can ya sheena don’t tell me i sang off key i will have a shitfit lollers so i was witnessing this conversation about making friends with anger and anger is my bff so i know a lot about it so of course instantly thought of pil’s “rise” you know “anger is an energy we will all rise anew yay mr rotten he inspires me ‘n shit we are going to have volunteers come next week first up is nikki sivils scrapbooker's new lines i absolutely love love love her new papers stickers and there are so many of them i had so much fun creating these projects with them here is my birdhouse with birdies that are holding a cute banner from her papers it's using the new summer line not really the moon otherwise our mom wouldn't have a kid anymore that wouldn't be fair eliza having been taught at the art academy myself for interaction design in the early ’ s one thing you learn early enough is that someone is an artist who can create a creative product out of passion instead of commercial purposes unrelated to the effect it has on an audience this does not mean that a true artist is someone who lives a live of starvation and anarchy defying everything that the society likes to consider as rules it means that an artist creates unrelated to how the audience responds art does not mean it cannot be a commercial success steven spielberg is a real artist martin scorsese walt disney… and many more even though they ended up to become very wealthy persons commercially very successful their careers started unrelated to the financial success often risking everything to follow their dreams and i consider knowing a bit now about the history of mr stern mr stern indeed an artist for he played the long game in this war but once up on that soap box he let us have his usual incendiary rhetoric how mobile phone tracking works adding emotion to your list of motives will support you even longer eg learning the language because your grandparents come from a different country or you would like to better understand that handsome exchange student police conduct countywide sweep of parolees with guns in going postal terry pratchett makes memorable the name of antihero moist von lipwig which takes some doing as a skilled conman moist is a master at offering others the “prospect of hope” but it seems rather unfair when all his efforts to escape ankhmorpork and its patrician lord vetinari start becoming only prospects of freedom from being hanged in the morning to being forced to accept a government job in the afternoon would be enough to drive anyone mad add in a golem for a parole officer a decrepit post office building complete with fanatic tenants for a home and a cynical miss dearheart for a love interest and moist’s new career seems hopeless fortunately the discovery that mysterious forces killed the previous four postmasters died suspiciously and that the head of the rival communications giant of clacks or telegrams has a brutal business agenda convinces moist that he must rise to the occasion at least it all comes with a hat first of all they’re disappointed at the men in their country let’s take thailand for an example the portion between men and women in thailand loses the balance and the quantity of female is much more than that of men so thai men can easily get a wife while thai women are difficult to find a husband however most thai men would not satisfy with his wife the family violence always happen in thailand and husband are inclined to have affairs with other women all of these hurts the feeling of the asian women for marriage so they turn to foreign countries for a better and healthy marriage the international committee on archaeological heritage management or icahm held its first conference on how to manage the world’s myriad archaeological world heritage sites this wildly varied array of places encompasses many of the most celebrated sites of human cultural accomplishment and catastrophe—everything from the pyramids and roman fortifications to mongolera tombs and prehistoric rock art icahm’s key job is to advise the world heritage committee about new sites proposed for the famous list i attended as a guest of the congress which paid for my travel and oh my god that was exhausting and hard and i cried the principle behind the pastry is to create many layers of dough and butter by folding and turning the two

their worlds and their lives sometimes they explore in steps both gentle and tentative sometimes in giant blind leaps both frightening and confidenceinducing and while i pride myself in living in the

book in this trilogy underworld does not disappoint oftentimes the second book is considered the filler and often riddled with unnecessary plot lines to extend a series but underworld is quite the opposite if anything this book has just built this story up to a perfect climax leaving the reader at the edge and ready to crash down to an incredible conclusion be prepared to be completely blown by this book and fall even harder for the king of the underworld her exhusband was charged with attempted murder in but has since been acquitted i’m glad i didn’t watch this in the theaters it would’ve

we decided on a warmup lap followed by minutes hard running minutes aggressive walking that we would repeat six times i set up my garmin to allow for the warmup and then chime when it was time to

god joe martin roderick russell and here’s a list of examples of each type of oil but text mining and mirror reading are not so useful in the case of romans because paul isn’t writing to a church he founded and because of that he pulls his punches tones down his language and works much more subtly than in say galatians or corinthians so scholars who simply look for the specifics of the letter or mirror read into it find some of the reasons paul writes but not the core issue so yes he wanted support for his proposed trip to spain and yes he wanted to address divisions within the roman church

i’m not bashing it as a story form but let’s be honest plotting a quest is relatively easy the characters must make a journey once you’ve decided where they start and where they finish constructing a plot is basically a process of inventing interesting obstacles and sticking them in the way of the characters in a fantasy world as a youngster i wrote fantasy you have a whole exciting array of potential obstacles that can be thrown at hapless questers dragons monsters orcs evil dark lords etc etc etc it was in the always in the script for joe to the little dance step i wanted him to do a

notice at spinning bean i say quasi because i will still be working there on mondays for the time being but i will now be full time at obsessions i am so excited to be there on a more regular basis where i can get to really know the customers and the store even better i have met some great ladies there and look forward to spending more time there learning and teaching we're definitely going back have you done any traveling lately or have any trips coming up is there anywhere you're dying to go but haven't yet the thing is a movie like this should have some scenes that are referential moments that we recognize from other disaster movies there are a couple one scene has bologna's character visiting a cemetery discussing his troubled life with one of the tombstones then the camera pulls back and you see several other people in the same cemetery having similar conversations with other tombstones another scene is the first reveal of the gigantic cyclops bus in a slow dramatic moment complete with a bombastic orchestral accompaniment only to be upstaged by someone observing that the huge bus line emblem was painted on backwards i also had to make a matching hair clippieno outfit is complete without accessories i think my niece is going to look so cute in this i will probably try to find her a cute white tshirt to go with it and hopefully she can wear it soon the painful scars remind me of you there are different degrees to this but the key is the removal of legal financial and technical barriers there also seems to be emphasis on use of open licences to support this and it should not involve copyright infringement one reason for the muchdiscussed refusal to issue demands is because issuing demands means recognising the legitimacy – or at least the power – of those of whom the demands are made anarchists often note that this is the difference between protest and direct action protest however militant is an appeal to the authorities to behave differently direct action whether it’s a matter of a community building a well or making salt in defiance of the law gandhi’s example again trying to shut down a meeting or occupy a factory is a matter of acting as if the existing structure of power does not even exist direct action is ultimately the defiant insistence on acting as if one is already free a rose is a rose is a rose is a rose is beautiful

before i’m capable of any other kind of response every channel you turn to another lunatic preaches several decades ago a male researcher did a project in which he gave a bunch of blocks to kindergarten kids and told them to build bridges the boys built bigger better bridges than did the girls from this he concluded that boys had a better understanding of the work ethic were more industrious and some other stuff so a lot of years go by and a female researcher repeats the study but she watches to see what the girls are doing what she sees is that the girls are a sharing blocks and b helping each other instead of competing they are working together instead of building bridges they are building working relationships “no black woman writer in this culture can write “too much”

general writing advice on a few topics and for you i think the best thing would be to start at the beginning of this blog and work your way forward since i've covered pretty much every topic under the

always on edge i wondered if it was his program he is working on his doctorate but i am beginning to think it is just him if we get together i think i might be able to show him how to take life as it comes i stress on some things but no longer allow myself to twitch at everything or even most things he sometimes thinks a snapping branch is somehow aimed at him no i am not laughing mostly i have

let's start out with a basic description so you can see why i was gleefully announcing on monday to my facebook friends that i had written a chapter and on tuesday i’d written two hallelujah the only reason i managed that was because i ringfenced december to write ho ho ho again so what will next week hold well – monday and tuesday morning i’d booked for writing – but unfortunately the lovely

she was once when she was on a trip to buffalo she talked a security guard into letting her into rich stadium where the bills play for a few minutes she had the stadium to herself she and i often took little road trips together mostly to san francisco for giants games one time one of our trips became the “trip from hell” as my mustang burned through a transmission line and we lost all of our transmission fluid in south sf in the evening this was not good we were in a very seedy neighborhood before the days when people had to be surgically removed from their cell phones she climbed over a wall of bums to reach to reach a pay phone to call aaa as i watched nervously from the car after waiting minutes we watched our tow truck pass by us never to return she made the climb again finally we

that read “sorry not working” realizing it was kids’ day at the giants vs rockies game and being surrounded by cottoncandy infused kids who kept kicking the backs of our seats while screaming “barry barry” one of my tires blew out on pacheco pass my mom got out the jack and proceeded to change the tire as cars whizzed by us and honked my job was to flip everybody off our motto for this trip was “we’re survivors not victims” my mom didn’t get distraught cry or bemoan our fate we laughed drank bartles and james long island iced teas from our cooler it was the s– we quickly moved on to zima

is the story goes…that a reaction occurs between the lime juice and the condensed milk which actually cooks the filling or makes it thicken substantially although you’re still required to cook it for a short time i used limes for this recipe but think that you could use more it’s very sweet and i think it needs a bit more acidity from the lime juice although if you have a super sweet tooth limes might suit you here we go “bagels” i was a diet coke junkie for the past years and stopped drinking them entirely september i was drinking close to gallon a day on some days now i drink unsweetened

supreme court on december this ruled that ab – which would have meant the redevelopment agencies handing over large amounts of their reserves to the state – was illegal the court basically reinforced proposition so far so good for redevelopment agencies and the california redevelopment association that represented them however the supreme court upheld ab – which meant that as the state had created redevelopment agencies and tif through the act and its addition it could also end them redevelopment agencies would be dissolved panic in the california redevelopment community set in attempts were made to build bridges with the governor’s office and the state legislator but to no avail tif and the plus redevelopment agencies that used the model to fund a range of projects around the state ceased to exist on february the result remains an absolute mess one sort of bureaucracy is being replaced with another successor agencies around california are trying to manage the winding down of a highly complex and locally specific ‘model’ meanwhile at the state level jerry brown is pulling in staff from different department to oversee the processes through which it gets to give the okay to some tif projects to continue and to end others watch out for wave after wave of court cases as all involved seek to establish landmark rulings and i’m not sure quite what there is to be done about it because i think done right it could be great—sweet and formal and oldfashioned without looking like something my grandmother would’ve worn to my parents’ wedding but i’m not quite sure what that is i

minutes remaining it will explode inside the building there are few whites blacks and asianmiddle eastern descents and one of them has the code to disarm the bomb so what would law enforcement do in a situation like this conduct a random check or eliminate the best possibilities by checking the middle eastern people first if there are statistics and reasons to believe that threat comes from a certain race is it unlawful to profile them if a white man goes on a killing spree then should we waste time checking black men same goes to blacks or any other race isn’t it simple and smart to stay

weak man yet his presence is as strong as a hero how ishiguro gave him a voice that is absolutely certain yet absolutely vacant of selfknowledge we know stevens and because we see his limitations we know things will be difficult for him don’t be afraid to give all the depth you can to your main character early in your story you’ll discover much more about him later and can always revise if necessary last thursday night my mother asked me to take her to an event a friend of hers had planned featuring a night out with author adriana trigiani i hadn't read any of her books but my mother loves them so i figured it couldn't be that bad right to my surprise it wasn't bad at all it was freaking hysterical looking closely at the typography of both the original cover and the “title” of the errata edition furthers my feelings of spacetime disruption adding to the weirdness is the slightbutnoticeable rise and fall in the handset letters of the musuem of modern art on the original’s cover

that doesn't count either so today is all about the funnest part of writing the work you do before you write and instead of walking out with one item which was my plan i never take them all in to get more than three things unless they are confined to a cart for that seems to be our chaos threshold we walked out with six individual items and to be honest we probably could have been good for a few

takes you to the modified version and this one to the original if anything the approaching experience may be the harsher of the two what nietzche was saying stripped of his ornate imagery was that the people of europe in his time no longer believed in the christian myths and doctrines they claimed to accept and needed to own up to the anthropocentric cult of power that had become their actual religion that may have been true still it’s one thing to realize that you no longer believe things you were raised to think were good and right and true it’s quite another and far more devastating to believe in something with all your heart and have it disproved right in front of your eyes the religion of progress claims to be justified by works not faith during the three centuries or so of technological expansion the apparent confirmation of the myth gave it immense strength as the age of progress ends and we enter on three centuries or more of technological regress the resulting body

sunday and remarked that there were a few teachers also working happened to be the four other kindergarten teachers at my school tulle colon cancer that had spread to his liver by breaking humans of this focus on ego he will change their focus back to concentrating on him or they will cease to exist he is accomplishing this by slowly removing the positive influence of the holy spirit on the world

the survey found half of men were physically dressed by their wives you know doing up their tie fastening their cufflinks or inserting their collar stiffeners not a euphemism kinda brings new meaning to the phrase getting up in the morning men keep their issues to themselves love is like a religion to them especially when they are blinded by it men might take time to fall nose deep in love but when they do they treat it like its divine if a guy truly loves a woman he never discusses the intricacies of the relationship with another soul during a hard time he controls his boiling rage by drinking it down instead of running around sharing his stories he slowly finds the solution to patch up things while his woman with her designed plans and strategies kills his love slowly but steadily if a man actually wants to tell his close friends that his heart is broken he simply approaches his gang and says ‘i am broken’ the next thing he knows is his friends dragging him to a bar and together getting sloshed now even if he actually shared the problem during his drunken yapping none of his friends will remember it the next day anyway i bought g of celebration but when i found each g were separate packs i decided to freeze one pk of powder whatever paste i had leftover my hair was to my bra strap in the back so i figured g would be enough but would rather have too much than too little distance learning instructional designer for the skill up network sun grant funded program if i have to choose one of the that joyce has listed i would choose an allday movie marathon but if i could choose whatever i wanted to do on a rainy day i suspect that i’d choose quilting but then again i’d probably put on some of my favorite movies to “watch” while quilting … so maybe i am going

were sleeping or simply not focusing on a particular thing—perhaps a thing that you grew up with something ineffably lovely—and now that “something” has vanished my favorite songs of all time frolicking swimming running up and down the hardpacked sand and screeching with joy like young gulls and finding treasures and swooping from the water to the sand to where the adults sat with their faces tipped to the sun and back to the water again arisa an interesting character if not actually likeable i don’t have to like a character to enjoy them her role was interesting her motives and plans varied even if the cause for them wasn’t really established all that well… she wasn’t a bad character to cry or to read brew pubs putting down roots and what the incarnation means for local living a local gospel must be important for a god who entered our physical space emmanuel to dwell with us i forgot to post last week but i should mention the th of feb was the th anniversary of the start of the healthy eating lifestyle change that lead to lb loss notice that the holy spirit and the word bear witness in heaven and are in unity with the father but on earth there are two

with him but still somehow managed to keep talking the whole time she held her cell phone above the table while she texted remember that…it’s important he on the other hand seemed fairly unenthused i don’t want to say he looked bored…but he did until he too received a text which livened him right up he immediately grabbed his cell phone and lowered it about six inches below the table…out of site…where only he could see it…and became equally engrossed in his textversation anyway to cheer myself up i bought chocolates hoping that they’ll make me feel better anyway walker's has been around

in geita for weeks is not ideal but we're going to do the best we can to make our time there useful carson will most likely do some filming in dar that he can't do in rural geita he may also spend some time on editing the footage and continuing to flesh out and develop the storyline for one of the films he is planning right now i'll probably be pretty preoccupied with is this baby ever going to come out thoughts but i'm planning to take some simple hand sewing projects along to pass the time and of course we'll be finding ways to keep jude entertained but as you can see from the photo i took right in prime time fest mode the attendance was pretty light and was not very beer geeky which is too bad perhaps one problem was the fact that it was scheduled on the same day as the obg's fresh hop festival at oaks park another problem might have been the lackluster effort at publicity this year i did not do my part i had intended to post a notice or two here but life got busy and i just plain forgot still i got no pr blasts to remind me which is kind of what i was relying on as my year old memory is well years old when i asked beer blogger friends about it the were not even aware of the date this year which is a shame as there a a number of unique things to recommend this fest looking for a chance to make money rather than spend it bring your snorkeling or even scuba gear and search

of brews like avery meph addict and russian river sanctification be sure to ask about barrel aged beers that aren't on the menu as they have a habit of sending old stanahan's whiskey barrels to local

admit it i haven't been successful all across the board traveling throwing a birthday party and buying cheese are all terribly difficult to do without using loads of plastic and i've done all those things in the past few weeks in a recent post i argued that an important role for art was as a means of communication at least that’s how it is often intended the artist ‘saying something’ to an audience “this here is beeyooteefuhl” or some such and how poorly or well supported some of the arts are is quite probably the result of how effectively artists are getting their message across why would something be supported if it was not understood if art is trying to be understood trying to be appreciated it does this only by communicating i go to the beach alone which at first feels like

i love blogging but i read some of the most clever posts on my friend's blogs and i can't help but think trish you have what sounds like a very mundane life in john we read and many other signs truly did jesus in the presence of his disciples which are not written in this book but these are written that ye might believe that jesus is the christ the son of god and that believing ye might have life through his name so we’re told that there is much more to know about jesus but we’ve been told just enough to fall completely in love with him and believe that he is who he claimed to be…the very son of god the giver of life just as moses prayed to the lord and fire descended from the sky and consumed the sacrifices so also solomon prayed and fire came down and consumed the burnt offerings on the

for summer's two best local beer festivals we're bringing beers that incorporate unusual ingredients the first to look forward to is the organic fest at overlook park where one of upright's two beers will be a special single barrelaged cask of the seven with hibiscus rose hips and rose petals the beer is set to be kegged directly from the barrel next week and will yield fewer than kegs worth of beer so far the flavors have been great with lots of floral character blending with the beer's citric quality and some deep background complexities give these a try they'll make your entire kitchen smell like christmas and it really wasn't that difficult it's actually pretty fun once you get the hang of it i continue to be amazed by people who make outlines of their stories know where the story line is going and most of all know the ending before even writing the book who are these godlike folk and why am i not like them i am a very off the cuff writer i don’t know where the story is going to go although i like to have a general idea before i begin i usually start with an idea or more often than not a sentence that seems to resonate in my mind until i get it down on paper novels and short stories start the same way a compelling first sentence on top of the two boxes of pizzas that were picked up to bring back for dinner was a bag of piping hot bread bites the aroma of fresh baked bread and its seasoning quickly filled the vehicle causing my taste buds and my tummy to turn summersaults in anticipation not to be unfair to the others i only snitched one of the bites from the tempting bag savoring every morsel of garlic and speck of parmesan that meal was over two weeks ago and i still think about those bites … but for more reasons than their taste i got a bit carried away and assumed that a couple of good performances in the carling cup augured a fine career i mean if that was how well they could play on their debuts then they could only improve from there right i mean obviously it'll never replace press advertising or anything that would be fucking disastrous but it's really becoming quite prominent all across the globally digitised interconnected world we all live

relatively simple the upanddown motion of the needle drives a sharp bit of metal back and forth causing fabric threaded through a particular part of the foot to bunch up how much it bunches per stitch is controlled by a little screw another little lever adjusts whether the gathering takes place on every stitch or only once per so many stitches this means you can technically use the foot for making pleats as well and control your gathering ratio quite precisely fabric tension and stitch length also play a role out here on the west coast lumber practically grows on trees there's so much of it yet

football and where does the egg money go into a tin on the top of a dresser we currently have dollars in the pot we’ve already contacted tom quigley – the chicken coop guy and asked him to put us on the schedule for a chicken coop addition sometime in the summer nothing big but something with an eastern exposure would be nice cold opening – a message from the president of the united states after my run this morning i went upstairs to shower and caught reflection in the mirror i began wondering if i would ever like what i saw in the mirror wasn’t that long ago…almost a year now…that i was over

the main character is actually a merman when your only friends growing up are a giraffe a herd of elephants a smattering of lions and a chimp named rocky your sense of right and wrong is bound to be somewhat offkilter compared to the rest of humanity how else can you explain the kooky positions held by the shapely protagonist in golden temple amazons aka amazons in the temple of gold a jess franco jungle adventure film produced by the fine folks at eurociné let's say you're little white girl growing up in the jungles of africa and your father steels some gold from a mysterious tribe of allwhite amazonian women and let's say they track said loved one down to his hubristic den of colonial vulgarity and kill your goldstealing father and your mother with poison arrows do you a swear to revenge their deaths b shrug your shoulders and do nothing or c thank the scantily clad white women for ridding the world of another pair of drunken prats and ask them to join their tribe while most normal people myself included would have chosen the third option without hesitation liana analía ivars decides that she wants to avenge their deaths at the hands of a tribe of gorgeous warrior women a tribe who seem to have an affinity for riding horses without the aide of tops i'll forgive liana for desiring vengeance when she was an irrational little girl but the fact that her thirst for violent retribution continued fester as a smoking hot adult didn't make a whole lot of sense you would have thought she would have figured out that her parents were dicks by the time her cantaloupes had begun to sprout nipples but what about liana's mother surely she didn't deserve to be shot into her chest with a poison arrow it's true technically her mom didn't steal the gold but she did shelter her husband and on top of that she seemed complacent over the fact that he stole it brandon and i continue to learn more about each other every day after over years together that is pretty incredible one thing we have seemingly had to relearn after having brayden is the way we talk to each other in front of others we like to joke a lot make fun of each other's misfortunes throughout the days for a good laugh and its not all the time either we tend to pick on each other especially to cheer the other one up if they have had a rough day but sometimes this can get taken the wrong way by others if they aren't around us when i saw this image of the men i knew i wanted to use them then i found this particular quote and suddenly my art journal was formed i'm not here to stir controversy about the

outside consultants in securing government appropriations and back on the road we drove north on university avenue towards hwy and menlo park but man are organizing and storage components expensive they add up quite quickly especially if you're overhauling your entire home like i am after hubby made me a delish quick dinner with store bought cannelloni one night i was washing out the pasta tray

cosmetics drawer this sunday is the tenth anniversary of september where were you most of us can answer that question a startling number of young people cannot remember they were likely too young to remember exactly what they were doing and what those smoking towers meant to the rest of us i remember where i was i was a new airman stationed in aviano ab italy looking forward to a peace time career and the benefits of serving overseas my memories of are a little chaotic and filled with the opinions and worthless whining befitting any nineteen year old i remember being righteously angry and a little confused about exactly what we were talking about when it came to taliban afghanistan islamic extremismtechnical school in intelligence did not put much emphasis on unconventional warfare at that time polyphony and chant provided by cantus magnus art historian richard shiff describes doubt and belief as two extremes on a continuum – doubt is a degree of belief while belief is also a form of doubt following charles sanders pierce shiff states “if belief and doubt belong to the same experiential category then a doubt is a weak belief we feel doubt when belief is weak reciprocally – but oddly – a belief is a strong doubt when the doubted fact gains degrees of acknowledgment it becomes a belief” doubt p ideally my practice exists near the middle of the continuum holding doubt and belief in magnetic tension my heart now bound woven and embedded has again healed itself the power of love is amazing it really is the only gift that you can give receive and give again there is

declared everyone too tired to think and sent them all to bed zephyr helped her put a shield around the house and ronan carried his daughter into sundance’s room so ash would not have to sleep alone ronan knew he would sleep better with sundance watching over ash everyone went to bed drained of emotion and worn down to the bone ronan checked all the windows and doors one last time as he shut off the lights warm hands found him in the dark hallway as he made his way to the room hero and jane shared before they went to their master witches ronan pulled sundance close and kissed her in the dark the dark which he used to never feared and once actually loved he always loved the stars which peppered it with light without overcoming it moon and stars filled it but it always remained dark now the dark even with sundance’s kisses filled him with a pulsing dread he had learned that while no monsters lurked under his bed many lurked in the edges of the darkness all too willing to destroy the weak nonmagical humans kate pierson iggy pop candy us as we are once more coming up to the anniversary of summorum pontificum it seems a good time to think about how much impact directly and indirectly the pope's more generous permission for the tlm has had in australia carl approach is to record the lecture in advance then ask students to view the lecture before the time table slot getting them to do this can be problematic but he encourages them to watch it by asking them to write questions relating to the lecture they also need to jot down when in the lecture the timeslot the questions arise doing this not only ensures students watch but reflection on the questions is a learning process as carl explains “one of the most important things in learning is asking the right questions” the questions are then uploaded to a community space wiki vle etc and then there is a poll allowing students to select their top questions these questions are addressed in the facetoface timetabled lecture slot wie in your book you refer to this new paradigm as “monistic idealism” and you also suggest that science seems to be verifying what a lot of mystics have said throughout history—that science’s current findings seem to be parallel to the essence of the perennial spiritual teaching so i have good news and bad news which one do you want first ok i will be positive and give you the

just going to stay in this weekend do a movie marathon or something the ipkat thinks this is not a very good term for one thing traditional and nontraditional are strange words for trade marks since

unschoolers learn only about what they're interested in won't they have gaps in their education yesterday i reviewed hunger games the books which i devoured over spring break i promised to review the movie which i went to watch sunday april with my oldest daughter k went to the midnight premier of the movie a few weeks ago but she was willing to humor her old mom and go with me to see it let me just say right off the bat the movie was close to the plot line which is quite unusual in my opinion when a book is made into the movie yet the movie was sorely lacking the shot above was taken a couple of hours into the long haul from sydney to san francisco aboard a united boeing then some hours later i gazed through my window as i tried to sleep and sat there transfixed by the colours that began to develop on the horizon from my vantage point more than feet up forget for a moment all the guff you get sent about social media brandbuilding and seo and concentrate on something worthwhile

flavour of the month for a while people are confessing to buying their first kindles daily online and reporting back when they’ve read their first books – “look at me look what i done” and i am one of them i’ve bought and paid for a couple of ebooks and even read one of them mostly i’ve used the thing to read stuff i would normally read on my laptop i proofread my last book using the kindle i didn’t make the corrections on the thing itself – sod that for a game of soldiers the interface will have to improve considerably before i’d even think about that – but i did use it as a way of making the text look new to my eye and caught a lot of things i’d missed on the computer spring is a beautiful time of the year in brisbane with jacarandas blooming throughout the city it’s a very colourful

or even go through the spiritual change when god already knows the outcome of my words and actions… for many years i was blind to the fact it’s not for gods gratification of watching us fail at times but instead a sign of respect towards god and a learning process for ourselves since we don’t know the outcome of the situations we face daily… thanks to comments and suggestions i have been trying to

dessert could be considered a health food in conclusion i owe it to my leaders to pray for them regularly and fervently look at timothy dishonorable mention extremely loud incredibly close – okay this film had enough redeeming attributes that i can’t rightfully call it one of the worst films of the year but god damn did it make me angry firstly it all hinged on the performance of a kid who doesn’t really seem to have a clue as to what “acting” entails the most maddening thing earning it’s unranked spot on this list is that it uses as a cheap gimmick to wring some unearned tears out of the audience has a place in cinema united proved that this is not that fucking place the fact that this got an oscar nomination sends the mind reeling like i said not necessarily one of the worst movies of the year though the more i talk about it the more i reconsider that but the dislike i bear this movie earns it a spot on here i hope that you have found this to be an interesting read and have not left you emotionally scarred enjoy your next meal because when i see your face a girl after my own heart i’ll train her to use that sword if arthur’s knights don’t more girls should learn to fight and

detective writer g k chesterton fell is an eccentric and colourful figure a man of gusto and animation his partner and foil superintendent hadley is a coolly rational detective who methodically investigates details of the murders i think the gay men of the london media set and their equivalents like dan savage and andrew sullivan in america are feeling very insecure at the moment bless them because the fact is people don't care as much as they used to about who has sex with whom and how we actually live in quite openminded times and this is not very good for gay men's sense of being

started thinking about just that sebastians novel response wae good he really there's something weird going on at our house right now i don't know if it's someone pulling a prank and trying to be

home and along with our sprinkler on our mail was on our front porch our mail lady never puts in on the front porch even if we have a package it's something small that's going on but it sure is irritating and completely inconsiderate that's money going right down the drain he’s a gentleman he’ll open doors for you make sure you’re seated comfortably carry heavy things for you and generally go out of his way to put your needs before his own the sand at her feet was created by sponging antique linen and old paper distress ink them i went back and dabbled antique linen and scattered straw distress stickles to give it a little more dimension i cut some clouds and masked them to create the cloudlike background the side panel was embossed with ossie dots embossing folder which i love and i wish i you could see it better but they are huge dots my new embossing folder i hated throwing it down the drain so i froze every last ounce of that liquid gold by the time my son was months old i had filled my entire freezer i did not want it to go bad so i starting calling around to the hospitals and other organizations to find out if i could donate it in the process of making calls i found out there was this gal on the other side of town that was getting ready to bring her first baby home from korea a beautiful month old baby girl with unrepaired cleft lip and palette he doesn't chew on them or anything at least not that i've seen but this is still a gross new hobby kind of cute but still gross she sent us all a picture of her holding it and a video during the later part of the summer treadwell would move camp from “grizzly sanctuary” to a grove of trees in kaflia bay which he liked to call “grizzly maze” here he camped directly in the middle of converging grizzly trails which were used by the wildlife nearly every day it was in this spot that he found his favorite bears in alaska and spent much of his time at the very least make what i’m watching interesting monday st forest meeting a blaze of glory so i finally managed to get rid of quite a lot of clothes that i'd been hanging on to for some strange reason they'll never fit me again even if i do lose weight

before i’d had a checkup and was told that if something hadn’t happened by february i’d be checking in to get the process started with a little help from the hospital i felt a little more relaxed one way or another the end was in sight and i would soon come facetoface with the little person who’d been listening to my bumpmumblings and kicking me in the bladder for the past few months your time will come ‘national tragedy’ tomorrow only may bride bikini is offering our amazing customers a discount off your entire purchase heeeeellllllloooooooo blog readers my laptop overheated this is not the first time this has happened but it is the first time in a long time and the first time since i last got it fixed up by my old friend arthur he’s a computer wiz but i haven’t seen or spoken to him since leaving wp what happened last time is it was a mixture of an accumulation of dust and poor ventilation the vents on my laptop are on the bottom of my laptop so it can’t easily get air since then i’ve been extra careful seriously i treat my laptop with more care than anything i own i’m not normally so careful when we watch house and i set it up on my chest of drawers i put it on top of glasses cases away from the vents so air can get into it from underneath however tonight i didn’t check it properly and one of the cases was covering the main vent which caused it to overheat and cut out it’s not a major problem as you can see just by reading this post it’s working again now but i’m gunna keep my usage of it to a minimum over the week use the main computer as much as possible and then on the weekend open it up myself and try and get the dust out without braking something tonight’s episode of house was the final one with stacy we finished the episode on charlie’s laptop another good episode i was going to bring my laptop into college tomorrow to help with the geology revision so we can look at some pictures of geological stuff in preparation for tomorrow’s practical exam she had ignited a tiny flame in me it was that old familiar flame of desire as i felt it flickering inside of me i welcomed it like an old friend unseen for too long a time as we walked the flame grew and grew at this bitter moment her sweet kiss had kindled a need for her not the need that could be satisfied by a kiss but a need to be with her be in her and be a part of her i felt guilty that i was feeling this need to make love to her and seek the succor of her warm delicate sexuality but i could not help it i am such a bad blogger it's been way too long since i've written a post i have been

see god move in jonah’s life as he had in nathan’s but the boy kept falling asleep what was i to do after the service was over we went to dinner since we had little time before we had to return to pick up nathan from youth group when nathan got into the car jonah told him about nick he reiterated every detail he remembered the video and some of the message nick was ten years old when he tried to commit suicide that is the age of my twins i was overwhelmed when he shared that part of his testimony i didn’t know if jonah was listening but he was why do i insist on keeping god small and yes

early october they were erased when i got an email on sunday that directed me to this link hi i love you what an amazing lesson marlita has known about the church for yearsher daughter and brother were even baptized years agobut she had always refused to receive the missionaries in her own home or to visit the church herself she is a member of the igreja assembleia de deus and even worked as an obreira for years the ones who peform the blessings of healing and always heard terrible lies about the mormon church and the book of mormon from her church leadersso she never opened her heart to learn more but lately marlita has been having difficulties and struggling with depression that left her softened and humbleso when geny told her about her recent baptism and the new joy and peace that she had found in the gospel and asked if she could bring us to meet her marlita accepted me guffawing where is that with no other frontrunners in the title race for a neutral this derby is shaping up

to file them gonna try and do that this weekend i am also a shall we say less than stellar housekeeper i think i’d probably be more comfortable in a tidier home this pattern can be broken… i just need to examine my motives and nowadays the draft is an occurrence that makes me so excited i regularly forget that it even exists this year…phew…what a doozy if my eyes rolled any harder i would have to call them “brittany murphy with the angels” i’m so sorry about that one you guys me and the word will not compete so if they cut out all the dialoguefree scenes and flashbacks i bet the last episode would have been minutes long and this stuff is getting repetitive how many times with park ha not answer her phone and yi gak spend all day looking for her and the evil couple i hope that those two just stay together because i’m sick of their numerous repetitive scenes having said that right now i’m more intrigued about how they solve this mystery of theirs the driving plot is moving quite slowly so i hope getting the romance in full swing means we’ll finally get the mystery going and they shouldn’t neglect the gaffer factor as well celtics’ doc rivers is a former nba player and a notable experienced coach not only the “big three” he could bring the most from the rest of his roster from rajon rondo tony allen up to kendrick perkins and frankly i’m kind of surprised when i look

before no contest he couldn’t bring the best of mike bibby and the heat’s bench yes geli dear but as every enron investor could attest the past is no guide to the future and your economy just slowed

brought caleb my husband into my life it was my desire to find ways as a single girl that i could be a blessing to a future husband that i didn't know yet i sought to find ways that i could be a

were about to go back home somewhere below tall buildings with yellow cabs and ambulances rushing past us on broadway it hit me like a sledgehammer the memory of how the sky would look during clear nights in the garden of our summer house the memory of a million glittering stars and my father calmly pointing out the various constellations as if on a map on the kitchen table we'll go there some

great stores but i knew what i wanted to look at long before i walked in in burberry i wanted to find the trench and i did how i walked in i started looking around i got approached and i accepted the offer of help i told the sales assistant that i was only looking i said this first off but i felt it time to think about investing in a trench given i've been considering this for ten years my sense

expressed by the likes of watson as a wakeup call for us to engage in sober reflection we take to the expression of woolly sentiment for me this type of reaction is a further evidence of our

little serious though i had thought that it would have a warm romance that would melt my heart as i had learnt that the movie was a huge hit in north america and it was really doing well during valentine’s day week so i was expecting a very touching romantic film to get out all of my markings i filled a small bowl with water and used a toothbrush to scrub them out it worked pretty well i think because this fabric has so much black the batting bearded a little and i had to use a lint roller on it next time – black batting review i picked up this book in the first place for two reasons because the author’s airborn trilogy are among my favorite books of all time and will finally be a movie after all these years and because i read the original frankenstein for class this semester and found it fascinating ba i wasn’t afraid of much but my fears were very similar to that of the character in my book i can remember when i was still young enough to have to hold my mom’s hand in the shopping mall we rode an escalator up to the next floor my foot or since i remember it that way it was probably just my shoelace got caught between the steps as they were closing at the top someone had to press the emergency stop button whenever anything like this or the story that inspired i’m not afraid of anything happened my imagination filled in what could’ve happened next so i guess what

in but this year even if i don't like someones voice i can see why others like it not only do i love polly and pip but i really like them they are smart funny and impossibly sweet for example polly

critique with superagent natalie fischer there are a lot of bold insecure and simply selfish people out there today who do not respect other people’s relationships and partners they usually women will often go out of their way to prove they are desirable by flirting with someone else’s man right in front of them often times it’s done for a competitive edge and for ego building either way it doesn’t matter what someone else is doing bc that cannot be controlled to a certain degree – it’s always left up to your partner to show no interest in feeding into that yes it’s flattering to be desirable to others whether you are in a relationship or not but it should not reach levels of outright feeding unless you are the kind of person who depends on others validation to feel completely desirable to your partner the problem is when a person who is in a relationship feeds into other people who are flirting with them who know they are in a relationship or even better knowing their so is standing right there with them it is the job of the person in the relationship to halt that in some manner if their partner is being put in an awkward situation and the addnotecommand event will fire the local

today was that the pharisees were very upset they told jesus to tell the people to stop saying these things then jesus told the pharisees that even if the people were to stop the very rocks would declare it so in my mind i never understood why jesus didn’t tell the people to shut up so the rocks would declare it how much more of a miracle would that be that would be awesome creation itself would acknowledge god before man so i just always thought that god didn’t want to perform on command for the pharisees another miracle they wouldn’t believe i didn’t get what jesus was saying or

for lemon curd filling this is stoic virtue as nietzsche clearly saw this is hardly the christian ‘otherworldlyism’ in which this world is devalued and some other world valued over life here and now in the manner which hadot rightly criticizes in his otherwise beloved neoplatonics the stoics have what today we would call an “immanent” ethics one which doesn’t have some standard of good or evil that would be transcendent of this world rather there is only one world of which the gods and spirits were a part and any ethics derives immanently from what’s here our explanations must now rest on two major foundations most neolithic genes were native but the major domesticates were exotic smallscale rather than continentwide migrations are the best way to integrate these into one model agriculture in a region may have been introduced by immigrants but that does not mean that the immigrants carried mainly near eastern genes richards rowleyconwy b zvelebil the lbk for example originated in the carpathian basin the population that moved westward emerged there carrying a complex mix of european and near eastern mtdna and no doubt picking up more as it moved how many of the thousands of minnesota voters who put michael paymar into office realized they were voting for a covert marxist has any of michael paymar's campaign literature or public statements ever mentioned his democratic socialists of america affiliation “well she has to have her colon checked and i need to have those easter island heads on my bunghole popped out or whatever then we’re off on vacation” only days to go till the premier of doctor who so i've posted something which i just noticed right now dour am pm be that as it may kilgore points out that the analysis is interesting because it shows that it isn't the wingnuts who have been purging the moderates in primaries it's a generational changeover mostly fueled by retirements there are reasons for the subsequent shift to the right but it's not just because voters are assholes who don't understand how the world works this moves the ideal attack point from the forums to the mobile apps it means that proper logging is introduced it is just as easy to see where an attack may originate and perhaps makes the interface for doing hundreds of brute force attacks much harder because perhaps it is harder to create a web app that simulates a mobile

cowritten by behn zeitlin the film starring quvenzhané wallis and dwight henry won the grand jury prize at this year’s sundance film festival so in all of these changes what do we hold to we cling to the lord who never changes malachi after all “the lord has established his throne in the heavens and his sovereignty rules over all” psalm the lord has used the past few months to remind me that he doesn’t call us to see the world through the lens of human logic he calls us to see the world through scripture and to make decisions to follow him based on our understanding of his character as seen in his word often the lord asks us take steps that confound all human logic additionally he often asks us for our very best – and many times he asks us for something he’s given us previously – the fulfillment of a promise in my case he’s asked for my dream job and not just once but twice last night was my very last service as the gathering georgetown‘s campus director in creating the photo project i was forced to attend to the ethical responsibilities required by complex environments i had to search for non copyrighted images to put into the image project and still find a way to site them within the project this helped me to understand that you cannot always go on the internet and save and use whatever you want because copyright infringement is very real the chapter that i connected with the most in completing this project is new media reader chapter the “cut up” method of william bourroughs in composing this image slide show we had to find pictures and edit them so that they would have meaning to the specific quote we chose and it embodied the very concept of the chapter being able to find something manipulate it and make it your own with a completely new meaning i plan on improving on this by finding other sources for non copyrighted material why couldn’t i plug in too this is one of the best parts of my job – not only do i get to give people back money they lost or didn’t even know they had through unclaimed property my office supports public schools by turning over millions of dollars each year you have if you're interested email me at

many brilliant children’s authors has just been a whole lot easier than wittering on about what i’ve been up to – mostly because what i’ve been up to equates to stress i can’t say given my post about being glass half full that i’m particularly proud of that but i guess sometimes life just gets in the way and gets overwhelming as we neared a point where we could either cross a road and head up the mountain or just follow the road back to the van we opted for the road it was shorter and as jason gary and ann were way ahead of us we thought it was our best chance of getting back to the van at the same time we all met back up and we told them about my mysterious throat drama and suzanne and paige scolded the others for getting so far ahead while they had to carry me up the trail the other three didn’t by it nine different duty stations … in stilettos and here are our choices for this year or at least all the ones my sleepy brain can remember the v word say it eat it live it many of my forbearers on the distaff side would have swelled with tribal pride at the thought of ireland as the promised land albeit absent the knowledge that american corporations would prostitute her for their

and hope to see them in classes i take in the future a quick trip to safeway and it was game on let us now consider some of the tactics the papacy is using to subvert the united states just because they call themselves a church does not mean that they are honest or honorable remember that satan the devil gave the papacy their power and great authority revelation the catholics through their jesuits are working to accomplish the exact opposite from what the catholic church claims they stand for for instance the church claims to be against abortion but their jesuits working in secrecy and masquerading as regular citizens in the government work to pass laws and make judicial rulings permitting abortion they have their right hand fighting their left hand to thoroughly confuse the people of the united states and to keep the people from ever connecting this evil conspiracy with them here is another example the pope gets on television and acting very piously prays for peace while his jesuits are behind the scenes stirring up all kinds of wars conflicts and terrorism in the world just as sin does not give birth to virtue so tainted and illegitimate electoral mechanisms cannot

role in the life of animists they see the world as full of spirits omens spells and forces through magic divination and sacred rituals they seek protection to appease the gods the spirits and the ancestors they observe numerous taboos and prohibitions and observe sacred places for example in haiti there is a sacred tree where a pact with the devil was signed over two centuries ago by witchdoctors animists see a whole host of objects as sacred things with sacred power they recognize sacred persons and observe sacred actions one of these is the circumcision rituals on young men in the xhosa tribe many hundreds of men have died from these dangerous circumcision rituals unfulfilled promises a year and one child later safa and issam returned to live in jaffa so that issam could

wonderful god seems to be very generous when it comes to handing me seeds to plant it’s good because new gardeners and farmers make mistakes in their planting planting or sowing isn’t merely a matter of throwing handfuls of seeds onto the ground and hoping for the best some seeds must be planted deeper than others some need more space while some are good with crowding some need more water or more sun or more acid or more alkalinity the production of a really beautiful vibrant fruitful harvest will probably be the end result of lots of mistakes and failures as the new gardener learns and becomes an experienced gardener the gardener who achieves fruitfulness will be the one who persevered “doing good” seems much the same if you could live anywhere in the world where would it be a couple of weeks ago i received an email from my school saying that as a top student i was nominated to compete to be commencement speaker i felt honored but i didn’t really want to do it first of all i don’t like competing for things second i don’t do well with public speeches especially if i have to read off of something my eyes start to water and then it will look like i am crying i don’t want to look like i am crying during graduation everyone knows the economy is lousy and has been for the last several years but our liberal friends ask us what exactly the republicans will do to make it better the answer is complex of course and includes several longterm issues but i always say that there are two obvious areas of lowhanging fruit energy policy and regulation a new administration could give our economy a quick and substantial boost by encouraging rather than blocking the development of america’s vast energy resources and by stopping the promulgation of endless regulations that burden business and by imposing needless costs make us all poorer the obama administration has been destroying wealth through irrational regulation at an unprecedented and accelerating rate as depicted in these charts from an earlier post dslr cameras capture their images on a silicon semiconductor referred to as a “image sensor” digital single lens reflex dslr cameras use either a ccd charge coupled device or cmos complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor image sensor most point and shoot cameras use a ccd sensor excluding cameras like the nikon d while almost all dslr’s use a cmos image sensor cmos image sensors derive their name from the way they are manufactured they are cut from a cmos wafer which is cheaper to produce then a ccd wafer provides less power consumption and also allow for more involved circuitry along side of the photosite array so basically the us site is a singleminded drilldown system that lets you instead look at all recordings at any point whereas the eu site thinks you might prefer all recordings but gives you a cumbersome option of using the drilldown system in other words arkivmusic has decided to partially hide its usp in favour of

questionable conduct lancôme had offered the lower court an expert report of a physicalchemical analysis of the two perfumes the report concluded that given the fact that there are hundreds of different components that could have been used it is highly unlikely that it is a coincidence that kecofa used of the exact components out of the in total used by lancôme the th ingredient was a cheaper substitute of the remaining trésor component since the expertise of the report was not denied by kecofa nor the accusation of copying the court concluded that kecofa must have copied lancôme’s

make my day better recently i asked radford what she was reading her replyi’m almost embarrassed to admit it but i’m currently rereading mansfield park for oh about the th time i have a bit of a jane austen obsession not only is she a beautiful timeless writer but there is also something so soothing about her novels – that elegant sweep towards a well ordered ending that i reach for them a little as if they were comfort food i always notice something new on each rereading this time it was the brilliantly waspish way she managed to pin down a character mr rushworth in half a sentence “he was a heavy young man with not more than common sense” – a salutary lesson on the power of brevity i did find as usual that i was cheering on the villains of the piece the witty lively amoral mr crawford and his sister while despairing at her supine goody goody of a heroine fanny price in this novel it almost feels as though austen is arguing against herself painting liveliness as a dangerous quality and championing a docile downtrodden girl who could not be further from her usual strongminded protagonists elizabeth bennett seems like a much more instinctively written and likeable heroine yes i must have read pride and prejudice times i’m still enjoying mansfield park though – there is something so irresistible about the “triumph of the underdog” narrative running through it that i’m sure this will be far from my last rereading liar liar pants on fire the ipkat found this in national geographic news on november boris volfson of huntington indiana received us patent for his design of an

discussing the issue cynically i found myself assuming the people we had been debating weren't actually committed enough to the process to enter into further conversation however immediately after the meeting one guy came over to continue the discussion within a few moments a group of a dozen people were talking about how power functions how latin folks are racially profiled as undocumented

made sure i read during both my break mins and lunch mins with the exception of a few interruptions the result is that at pm gmt i've now read pages of 'crusade of tears' by cd baker in half an hour “look i’ve seen people do a lot of weird stuff like moving objects or bending spoons it’s psychic energy not magic the magic the coven raises is totally different we agreed to this experiment of his

completion and post completion steps of leases i have been told i’ve been getting on well and they’ve been pleased with the work i’ve turned out i have had to keep going back to them about things –

we had over inches all across north alabama i know i know my northern friends this is not a lot in comparison to what you get however let me point out again this is alabama we as in the state are not prepared nor equipped for this type of snow we have a few snow plows but not enough and when it snows here it melts and turns into black ice black ice is very very dangerous especially at night as you might imagine our city surrounding counties have been closed down since late sunday night today is tuesday school has been canceled since sunday night and is closed at least through tomorrow wednesday

is a pretty good foam cleanser as i find it quite gentle on my skin cleansing properly but not stripping my skin of moisture often cleansers that promise to remove excess sebum tend to be a bit more harsh and end up drying out the skin but dove knows a thing or two about moisturising and this selffoaming cleanser did not disappoint my face feels fresh and clean after using this with no feelings of tightness i believe the balance of having the orange oils and hydrating lotion that dove is known for has created a great basic cleansing product you cannot have a relationship with food use food

the conflict through the character of the wasp captain thalric who has a great deal of honor and passion for his ideals though thalric is the most fleshed out of the characters in the wasp army his

only a democracy of objects where every object is on equal ontological footing despite there being hierarchy and inequality among units but also a democracy in objects in irreductions latour notoriously says that “we will never do better than a politician” here latour is referring not to state leaders though them too but objects or actants in general every entity that enters into relations with other entities is a politician insofar as it must navigate the tendencies or singularities of the other entities to which it relates but not only this every objects must navigate the units of which it is composed docile bodies are never a reality but always a dream for some despicable units the subunits always have their own say and their own aims or tendencies such that every harmony is only provisional it is for this reason that every unit is fraught with unitspecific entropy from within the subunits out of which a unit is composed always threaten to fall apart such that constant activity or operations are required for the unit to continue or endure but it also follows from this that the units that emerge out of subunits are never simple masters of what they become the components that compose a smart phone contribute every bit as much to what that smart phone becomes as the engineers that designed the smart phone the engineers had their idea of how the phone should be composed the parts or subunits had their “idea” this is because the structure of the various parts and the tendencies that dwell within their parts go in directions that the engineer must navigate suddenly the engineers find themselves faced with problems and constraints that make the phone as finished product go in a very different direction than they intended as a consequence

tidings even though they have no reference to the present are likely to cause no little alarm to their hearers especially when the obscurity of the future engenders the suspicion that what they hear may come to pass just as the voyager who is about to cross the sea before him when it seems probable that a storm will actually arise and the billows rage and the wild waves lash themselves in fury even though he do not see these things before his eyes and they stand yet merely in expectation and that perhaps baseless fears them as though they were in his sight he then fitly raises up anew his disciples trembling and struck with terror at these dreadful tidings and stupefied by the thought of future trials to a sustained courage and leaving his sad discourse speaks to them of their joy of heart in god for it is not he says o my disciples for this cause that i have now spoken these words unto you to rob your minds of courage or to inspire in you a vague terror nor that you should be found altogether broken down by the thought of evil to come and unable to endure to secure your own blessedness but that you might be quite otherwise affected and have pleasure of heart in me and that

happy friday there is nothing magical going on as the author has opted to instead focus on the creatures and steampunk technology which appears aplenty towards the end overall soulless flowed well but the middle was a little slow with the romance aspect taking a bit too much time to cement itself there is plenty of action and witty dialogues along the way to things keep moving a pace the dialogue and alexia's own internal thoughts were the best aspect i thought the properness of it all would grain on me after a time but the author interjects so much humor that she averts that chasm to the point where i looked forward to having things made more formal again to appreciate the jokes and situations there is a wide cast of characters many of which i would have liked to learn more about with more planned books i am sure some will end up better fleshed out i especially loved the inclusion of the waxed face man and his associated mythology it is one type of creature i think should get more used in fantasy books but is generally overlooked for wikipedia wednesday july my cabin the cavaliers was hiking mt giant for me the mountain was hard and easy at the same time the reason why it was hard is because of the steepness the reason why the hike was easy is because i made my own short cuts and because there were some flat spots going up and down the mountain going down the mountain was pretty difficult the reason why going down the mountain was difficult is because i had to use a lot of force with my legs the reason why the hike going down the mountain was fun is because ms o’leary was telling fun stories and i was telling some fun stories and that made the hike pretty fun turtle pug a rewind reality check i broke your heart you can see a gorgeous green gem that i tucked in on

main ingredient is malted barley you can use other kinds of malted grain like wheat but barley is the principle grain in most beer malting is the process of just barely sprouting the grains then drying and lightly kilning them to halt the sprouting process as a kernel of grain sprouts its chemical composition changes most important for us if you take sprouted malted grain grind it up and add hot water to form a porridge at just the right temperature typically you end up with something in the deg f range the enzymes in the malted grain will be activated and they will begin to crack down

unabashedly adore everything about fall it is conceivable that the copyright owner might in certain cases be able to draw the attention of the isp to the fact of a present infringement or to the likelihood of a specific infringement occurring in the future and to invite the isp to terminate or prevent such an infringement in these circumstances if the isp was liable to terminate or prevent the present or future infringement a real question could arise as to whether the isp was being made liable 'for the information transmitted' or was rather simply coming under an obligation to use its technical facilities to terminate or prevent an infringement in respect of the information transmitted committed by another person the 'careful balance' struck by the community legislator settles that issue and removes all uncertainty by allowing member states to authorise the courts or competent administrative authority to order the isp to terminate or prevent the infringement so long as the isp is not made liable by way of fine or compensation in respect of the infringement itself i don't even know what to do anymore do i spend the next few months taking her back to bed multiple times a

refused to finish the trilogy not only because it should be called shades of vomit with regards to some of the material and also the dialogue between the main characters but also because the plot line

africa’s corporations have not yet begun to understand that value for money customer satisfaction more profits companies here still believe that they have to anally rape their customers and it is accepted as ‘the way things are’ let me put this in perspective in the uk for the princely sum of per month approx r you can have g internet bandwidth unlimited unrestricted mbps bandwidth you can get a mbps internet line installed at your home and they will throw in a phone line with free national calling and cablesatellite tv package with over channels this will set you back about per month about r installation is done within a couple of days and if they don’t turn up when they say they will you get apologies and free shit to compensate corporations in the developed world can somehow afford to make their shit affordable to the masses you could argue that there are more people in somewhere like the uk and therefore it’s easier to market to the masses but the simple fact is there aren’t that many more people in the uk than in sa so how do british telecom virgin media sky and all of the other giants make these unlimited bandwidth options available to the masses well it’s because they make customers happy and they compete as a result the subscription figures are higher and justify the investment in bandwidth europe doesn’t know what ‘capping’ is litres of milk at the hour tesco supermarket will set you back about that’s cheaper than here in sa what is more shocking is that biltong a typically south african delicacy is now available in uk supermarkets at about half the cost

when i first realized this it’s not a big deal at all hang in there folks…this is the fun part i suppose if mice don’t bother me tonight and i don’t get eaten by a bear i’ll have to concede frenchy’s point it's amazing how many times i've watched this video in the last few days to be honest i sort of found it by accident while trying to find another version of the song despite its being minutes long i decided to watch it anyways and i can't seem to stop watching it it's the most wonderful time who flutters by the only upside to that last part is that sleeping is one of the rare activities

every homemaker out there will be able to convince their families that this meal is the most amazing food ever fortunately for me my husband was raised in the south and this was a staple in his home

hearing from you the past years have been tumultuous for swindon going through the pain of administration nearly years ago suffering a playoff loss to brighton years ago becoming the first former premier league club to drop to the bottom tier of the english football league in and suffering two wembley heartbreaks in two years but this promotion under a manager who has done so well with a club that was in disarray at the start of the season tastes all the sweeter after a terrible season that ended under the stewardship of the hapless paul hart the committee also found that case dockets went missing at the station there were investigations initiated on the missing dockets but it was not clear what would happen afterwards which is often even better than the former life seaweed it wasn't

options out there i think i’m making it sound more boring than it is but i want to really fix this in my memory and in the blog’s memory this is the first pulitzer novel that’s not only been sympathetic to a minority but has actually succeeded in treating minority characters with the dignity and respect of being real human beings in order to do that la farge has to jettison a lot of other things but the result is this quiet little novel that begins in childish joy and ends with very mature grief a novel that years later is still moving to me at least because it makes its characters too real for me to avoid feeling their emotions alongside them he finds a way of writing that simultaneously makes the foreignness of their phrases clear they speak a different language than i do and yet does not destroy their intelligence by dumbing down the dialogue i don’t know if high schoolers today would sit still for laughing boy but if they did i think more of them would connect with the story than wouldn’t and in the end it would spark the right kind of conversations about america that is can still do that now makes it a worthy pulitzer winner in my book even if it isn’t wharton and it’s

and curriculum standards for your state or province the vast majority of these standards are developed around the concept that a liberal arts education as opposed to a more focused skills training type of education is the best choice to ensure that students are able to think critically and expansively and to solve problems there are actually some pretty good arguments to be made in favor of a liberal arts education personally i am not a big fan of any approach that dictates that there is a specific body of knowledge that you need to have in order to succeed in the world there are simply too many examples of healthy happy productive people who know so many disparate things and don't know so many others to categorize good and bad education so simplistically i also don't subscribe to a pedantic i teach you school of thought when it comes to education because i believe that people learn best when they enjoy what they are learning and are able to apply those learnings to some

of the girls birthdays in an attempt to polish islam's image muslim activists usually quote verses from the koran that were written in the early days of the islamic movement while mohammed lived in mecca those passages make islam appear loving and harmless because they call for love peace and patience such is a deception the activists fail to tell gullible people that such verses though still in the koran were nullified abrogated rendered void by later passages that incite killing decapitations maiming terrorism and religious intolerance the latter verses were penned while mohammed’s

can choke out the life in our hearts matthew the results are devastating ”for what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his soul or what will a man give in exchange for his soul” matthew in the sermon on the mount he told them that the unbelieving world eagerly seeks and worries about such things as food shelter clothing but his followers are to “seek first his kingdom and his righteousness and all these things shall be added to you” matthew though suffering for christ is inevitable the disciple will be cared for and honored by christ ”he will receive a hundred

skating competition we ended up a restaurant together and after my family had finished our meal i approached the table of the girls their parents were sitting at a separate table and started chatting them up hit a yard sale and dropped in on fredrick of scandinavian grace in the winter of the year there is a viral video going around the internet where a father admonishes his daughter for complaining about her chores on facebook in the video the father reads the daughter’s incriminating post and then “answers” her concerns now i don’t know if this video is a fake or not but i do want to say a couple of things about the dad he claims to be in it he fixes computers for a living yet he is wearing some kind of indiana jones – type hat he gives the entire chatising speech from an adirondack chair in a nondescript grassy area i mention this because i assume that most computer geeks do not own adirondack chairs nor have access to the outdoors he stutters i do not mention this to pick out someone’s flaws lord knows we are all flawed this is a requirement for a human being however this dad stutters as if he’s memorized something and can’t quite remember it like he’s auditioning for a high school play he shoots his daughter’s computer with a gun really isn’t that a bit much perhaps taking a sledge hammer to it was a little too reminiscent of the movie “office space”…however i can’t help feeling that a man who owns an adirondack chair an australian outback hat and a glock – is not only not a dad but also not an information technology employee i could be wrong after all this

dominant element either that does not make romance bad or inherently less worthy than books that are all wit or all humour or all adventure or all deep introspection sorry i've just been seeing the implication that romance writing is less than worthy for months and have been meaning to yell about this for a while i think i tweetyelled a few weeks ago it just makes romance not my cup of tea and that's okay for me and all those writers who want to write their romancedominated stories but i cannot help remembering an earlier time when my body was full of youthful vigor and my heart and mind were full of romance and i went running to a friend's house in the middle of the night to celebrate what i thought would be the wedding of the century but an iaaf source was today quoted as saying

importance of knowing when the follow the rules and when the break them tucked in here is writing advice gold as the importance of readability is stressed in five simple points a secret weapon useful

in whatever they do starting solids attention preemie moms but of course i would love feedback from everyone what is your view on solids did you do purees how old was your baby when you started preemie moms did you wait til your child reached the appropriate adjusted age or actual age i'm having a bit of an internal battle with this turtlelove will be months in weeks he is sitting supported and has some moments of balancing upright on his own he salivates at the table when we eat and stares hardcore at food we have been letting him hold breads for a couple weeks but he wasn't interested in putting them in his mouth i've spoon feed him formula supplements a couple times to see how he does with the spoon btw he loves it and grunts and whines if i'm not fast enough the past three times we have handed him a bread item a biscuit a pizza crust a cracker he has put them in has mouth i made it a game and took it from him before he could ingest anything the last thing we gave him was a cracker days ago he slobbered on it and broke a piece off i was terrified at first and then watched him chew it i made it a game again and fished it out lol he thought it was funny originally i wanted to wait until his month appointment to see what the doctor said about starting him on solids mainly because he is a preemie and i worry about his digestive system being ready he has given me tons of signs he is ready though i'm just not sure i know i'd like to make my own baby food when we get to that point it is hardly surprising that so many people are angry that cornwall council appears able to find monies for certain projects while it continues to cut services and make staff redundant in this age of austerity they found the baby dismembered in the bedroom with three of his toes chewed

the room upstairs really kitten mysterious phone calls to the man who delivered swendsen to the corwith home add to the suspense each chapter ends with an italicized section that give us insight into the patient in the room upstairs we know the thoughts and feelings of the patient and watch as this person turns the pages of a diary written of course in the first person but with all references to kitten in the third person the diary starts out with glowing entries showing admiration for kitten then reveal petty envy and finally explode into bitter hatred but then the diary can't be kitten's can it why refer to herself in the third person and if it isn't kitten's diary whose is it and how did the patient get a hold of it having several positive home pregnancy tests taken a blood test and having positive results at this point i would suggest to make an appointment with the gynecologist where you will be given confirmation of the test results along with your first sonogram some clinics will not offer a sonogram during early pregnancy some require that you are at sonogram least two months pregnant before performing a sono on you because of the high risks of having a miscarriage since most miscarriages happen during the first two months of pregnancy it would just be more emotionally harder for the mother after seeing their baby on the monitor or picture of a sonogram what is clear

the classic recipe the film opens by explaining how the twin sisters get separated at birth and brought up by different families but there are no mystical songs lockets or other identifying objects needed because the two just happen to be identical which means of course that there will be confusion between the two when they grow up but even that as sweet as it sounds doesn't always deflect the criticisms when they do come there are a number of ways a parent can respond some parents choose the fuck you approach in practical terms this often takes the form of my choices are not up for discussion and if that doesn't work for you then stay away that's an okay approach for as far as it gets you which is often to a place of hurt conflict an negativity i have always resisted this approach based on something my dad told me when i was very young when you wrestle with a pig the pig has a blast and you just get crap all over yourself nothing joyful or productive about that and yet there are times when the complete opposite takes place such as this week a lot has changed in the years since dark shadows has left the air television movies music and comics are very different often slicker and more sophisticated still there was a special feeling in the air that fades with the passing of each individual who brought their own personal stamp to the work they produced danny pongo how're you doin old pal exclaimed juju brush earlier in the semester when we reviewed foucault we talked about his general rejection of sexual identity formation as a means of sexual liberation to deleuze zeroing in on a sexual identity would inevitably just limit a group of individuals who could be vastly different from another lumping them together by one common trait even if that trait itself is a unique individual experience this identity would not really designate what this person is it would only remove the possibilities of what a person can become thus ascribing an identity becomes a repressive force instead of a source of strength but maybe if i keep doing it then i might start having to let go less and less and then before long i will have let go without even realising it after what i can only assume is the worst night of sleep in my entire life the air mattress i slept on collapsed under my burly weight i awoke around am and felt the curious sensation of having a deflated balloon attached to the roof of my mouth i swallowed once and felt a large flap of something undulating in my throat my first inclination was to assume william and javen had played a

called me back ahead of schedule but david showed up just in time the bulk of what’s written above applies to mcpherson and his trio as well as it does to as this is innocent music pure music let’s neither get all alan lomaxy nor let’s pretend that innocence or purity are aspects which automatically lend music power or punch who hasn’t seen earnestasfuck crapshows but again as with as there’s a directness and joy in what mcpherson’s doing or at least that’s what it sounds like to this listener here’s what you should maybe know as well everything used to record and make signs and signifiers was made before often well before a move like that could depending on the seenitall worldweariness of the listener strike as a gimick or schtick—i wonder how i’d feel it say the strokes were to try a stunt like that i don’t know i’d claim though that mcpherson and his bandmates did not endeavor to make an album like signs and signifiers out of any avaristic let’slooklikethis intent who knows maybe they did but i doubt it what it sounds like is they’re into this oldtime rockroll music which let’s be real clear mcpherson’s songs could be fucking outtakes from ray charles’s magic 's years i’m not kidding and they’re trying to make the best oldtime rockroll album they can meaning it doesn’t remotely sound like they’re trying to appear any certain way meaning they are—like the alabama shakes—about as rare as it gets in terms of modern bands and music folks who seemingly truly don’t give a shit about coming off any certain way other than trying as hard as they can to get to the sound and idea they’re most moved by if you think i’m crazy and that this is more common than i’m believing it to be i’d simply ask when was the last time you were surprised by music we talk about adele with such reverence for a reason and we did about amy winehouse the same way for similar reasons and we talk about radiohead for similar reasons all of these folks i’d argue that they share an uncompromising unselfconscious drive to get to the music they’re most moved by holy hell do you owe it to yourself to listen as do we all open boat time “great dancers are not great because of their

was 'yummy chocie eggs' i have to say the girls' performances were just wonderful so was the work of the school staff what really shocked me was the audience of course everybody was like hours late this is normal here but even when the action on stage started women were still arriving and behaving as though nothing formal was going on walking around talking loudly laughing and paying little attention to what was going on on the stage it all looked more like a dress rehearsal to me than an actual performance day this continued even when the principal was giving a speech but she didn't say one word to make them quiet as if this kind of behavior was normal i ended up buying a bike friday and although not offering the greatest fold it was still good enough for my daily train ride from

since season and they finally start getting it together and they get engaged cristina and owen are together but he has issues with his ptsd leftover from iraq meanwhile izzy and alex are together but izzy has stage melanoma and she is dying her dream is to get married the traditional way with a big fancy white wedding so mer and der got married on a post it note and alex and izzy got married in a big fancy church wedding ceremony guess which marriage didn't last that's right the church wedding ended in divorce izzy left alex after she almost died and couldn't take the emotional stress of having cancer sad cuz they were cute together but it wasnt meant to be well alex got a new gilrlfriend lexie who also happens to be mer's sister there is a merger between seattle grace and mercy west hospitals so a bunch of new doctors from mw come into the picture der becomes the chief of surgery mer is afraid to have kids with der because her mom had alzheimer's and she thinks that she will get it and so will her future children but der convinces her to not worry about that and whatever happens happens derek and former chief webber we'll just call him the chief its easier that way treated a patient who had a brain aneuryism and became braindead her husband mr clark didn't want her to die so he begged der and the chief not to pull the plug on her but she had signed a dnr meaning she

consists of notes of italian lemon citron pettigrain bitter orange galbanum lentisque fig leaf and lemon tree wood and is an olofactory interpretation of the mythic garden of hesperides given that i'd been convinced i disliked citrus and felt quite snobbish about fruit it seems an unlikely choice but lord is this a beauty at first sharp bracing cool green and bitter it settles into a wonderfully dry dusty but creamy warmth on the skin a lot of the time fig smells very much like blackcurrant to me one of the fruits of my childhood and beyond that ninfeo mio feels like the secret garden out of the frances hodgson burnett novel which is one of my alltime favorite books so there it is an embodiment of something out of my past and something out of my dreams all of the elephants lie down rated of a very good book once the chicken is golden add the mushrooms and carrots and stir for a couple of minutes to soften slightly to me the nba is the one major league in the us your time will come soon soccer where the players dominate the league reaches a level of personality that you cannot see in any other sport sure every sport has a few people who radiate that personality ken griffey jr alexander ovechkin and terrell owens come to mind immediately but the nba differs yes they run plays and each team has its own philosophy but each and every player has their own distinct way of playing for example dwight howard and andrea bargnani are pretty similar body types but could you think of two more opposite players but this isn’t just about body types take the most highlighted play

the first time since i’ve been here that i had to remember to always eat with my right hand the man is a christian churchgoer in wouram but comes from a muslim background so i didn’t want to do anything impolite we also ate avocados there were two avocados that were cut into quarters and we used spoons to scoop the fruit out we drank hot tea with sugar at first and then cold milk they said

realised very early that if i was going to ‘make it’ in this side i needed to be fit i had to train hard and learn the right drills and skills so i could compete to the best of my ability in this side

participate in this challenge i had a groundhog day moment this evening while starring at the tupperware cupboard strewn across the kitchen floor following my daughter around the kitchen turning off oven knobs closing cupboards changing yet another nappy loading up the layers of pj's dosing my sick baby up with her antibiotics and some panadol and stepping over all the toys in the lounge room it was just seeming all very mundane then when i thought about some of the new and cute things she did today i know it makes it all worthwhile yet the mdc have thus far participated in these discussions because their options are limited zanupf have refused to give up power and under mbeki’s protection have committed enough murder and intimidation to “win” last month’s farcical presidential runoff in which there was only one candidate i hate that the discussions have been driven into the floor so hard that it is pitting two good things against eachother examples head versus heart doctrine versus devotion passion versus reverence or being rooted versus being relevant we should be saying and and not versus i can’t see any scenario where you should have one without also having the other not exactly true i’ve tried to turn my head away from some quirks that bothered me about men i’ve dated in the past namely ones who live in disgusting hellholes they never can clean or pickup a couple of guys who believed in toking it up on friday and saturday nights was more exciting than a nice dinner and movie somewhere and one guy said his favorite past time was sleeping…i gave him a chance…ok maybe just one chance but that says a lot you know what i really wanted while watching the previous wrong turn movies to know how the inbred freaks started out i guess that’s what the filmmakers thought but who the fuck cares they’re not interesting characters and you know what they did before they killed people they killed other people i didn’t need another movie to make it clear and then in chapter one…oh yeah your blue eyes look like holes then it happened one day last week he began to be a sincere participant in class his comments were relevant and on point after class i told him how much i appreciated his contributions then he took the unit test and scored decently on it and he was proud of his accomplishment today they jigsawed articles about the s in preparation to read to kill a mockingbird the other students in his randomly chosen group looked at me “really ms l i have to work with him” one of his group members has been begging me to send him to the office or kick him out of class all term as they discussed their articles in their groups manuel started to expound on the great depression the economy hoover and roosevelt when i walked by he would stop me to corroborate a fact of his i would agree with his fact we would discuss it in front of the other group members and i would move on i watched him interact with his group all of whom thought he was stupid they were having a real and earnest discussion of what it must have been like to live back then circling around again i heard the girl who is gleeful when he doesn’t show up to class ask “how do you know so much about history” she sounded a little awed i rooted for him silently “prove your stuff manuel” at am keith was just getting home from practice we leave for church at i had two kids dressed for church and i was ironing my clothes one of the boys was still in a pajama shirt and no pants nobody had socks or shoes just yet i wondered about a couple of the names i found on my map and whether they too are references to native americans i wouldn’t mind living in round head though i’m not sure if that’s a title a native warrior would cherish still it’s better than round bottom or worse long bottom why did i follow a stout with this ipa i'm not totally sure i know i wanted to continue the high qualitity i had just had had i didn't want to be let down with a lacklustre beer and the last

to grant institution the form known as duplex querula was adopted which consisted of a complaint tendered to the archbishop against his ordinary for some alleged denial of justice the dean of arches sir h j fust issued a monition to the bishop to institute mr gorham within fifteen days or show cause for refusing institution to be proceeded with by default the bishop responded by what is called an act on petition in which he included the book published by mr gorham containing a detailed account of his examination the bishop expressed himself convinced that mr gorham was of unsound doctrine in respect to the efficacy of the sacrament of baptism inasmuch as he held that spiritual regeneration is not given or conferred in that holy sacrament this elicited a defensive rejoinder from mr gorham the case came on for hearing in the arches court in february and judgment was given in the following august in favour of the bishop sir h j fust concluded his judgment by stating that the doctrine of the church of england undoubtedly is that children baptized are regenerated at baptism and are undoubtedly saved if they die without committing actual sin mr gorham has maintained and does maintain

which loiselle notes being the topics of queer culture and the media panopticon that made themselves present in quebec cinema of the 's and 's brault was involved in echoing and projecting every major aspect of quebec history activating during his time behind the camera from early commercial cinema little aurore the martyr child on which brault was assistant director to jeanyves bigras to the emerging direct cinema les raquetteurs with gilles groulx and the classic of whales the moon and men with pierre perrault onward to auteur cinema mon oncle antoine directed by claude jutra to the rise

today i started the day with waffles i'm still on a breakfast honeymoon with my new waffle maker and some serious budget evaluating i've been pretty lax with my budget lately with christmas presents a new stove a trip to chicago jayz and kanye and a grouponinduced eyeglasses purchase so it's time to get back on track instead of using quicken to plot my budget based on what i'd like to spend on each category i started plotting this year's budget based on what i've actually spent on each category and then making a few adjustments i think this will be much more reasonable and set me up for success rather than failure and overall for the year i didn't do so bad you know i'm only beginning to get a handle on the promotional leg of my publishing journey but with friends like this i think it'll be

on her face sadist sedona lace contour blush palette contour as you move forward on your journey you can expect that few will understand and even fewer will care in fact it is very likely that no one will care about your efforts to selfactualize any attempts to engage someone on the subject will end up dead in the water people are either too uncomfortable about the issue they don’t understand it or they are just not interested you will quickly realize this when you see eyes glaze over at the mere mention of the word selfactualization and you will come to see that you are essentially on your

remember her past surgeries and how tough they were then imagine this time around being so much harder i'd worry about complications i'd think of the worst case scenario then i'd tell myself to stop breathe and say a prayer to stop my crazy mind it was hard in the hospital and there's been hard moments since and people ask how i'm doing it and i just want to make them understand that it dosn't really matter how hard it is the happiness to have it over and done with a great outcome makes any hard day or moment okay i don't think even in my wildest hopes and dreams i would've thought we'd be

made from seitan roasted red peppers caramelized onions and spinach the seitan was light with a fairly good flavor i often steer clear of seitan because the texture irks me however this particular seitan was surprisingly good overall the inside of the crepe was delicious even though the onions could have been caramelized a bit more but i just couldn’t get past that crepe shell “sir thomas moore

from the drop of jealousy and envy that we draw our ambitions and goals in life from the tiny drop of envy and jealousy we develop admiration and inspiration if used in a constructive way it can serve as our motivators to push through in achieving what we want or even do more because we admire others who are able to get to where we want to see ourselves in a span of time so we make them as our inspiration to motivate us in succeeding too however in most cases a person gets consumed by hisher envy and jealousy instead of developing it to admiration and inspiration it becomes anger and hatred and sadly family members are not an exception many may be opposed to this but in fact envy and jealousy are pretty common among families and relatives normally they don’t show it hypocrisy is the common practice they may show you happiness and support for your success but deep within them are their insecurities that is developing to an overwhelming envy and jealousy where covetousness is likely to flareup nevertheless there are really those who have pure intentions and are really happy for a family member’s success i want money to be a positive thing in my life not just one more

societal turmoil has often shared the characteristics present in america today degraded peoples rallied by orators who are capable of capturing the spirit of discontent to win over adherents in droves these situations provide fertile ground in which a great populist orator who has understood intimately the plight of the masses and who is capable of rousing their deepest fears and highest hopes at

place for themselves in the kingdom of god they were actually destroying the people of god paul gives them a very severe warning i warn you as i did before that those who live like this will not

an opinion – and that is an ever evolving process the problem is that most of the world are constantly forming opinions based on hearsay and a little personal reflection then proceed to overestimate their ignorance i would rather value the man who says ‘i don’t know’ and gives his soul to finding out – and the very few men who have come back with a treasure the others only indulge in their own vanity the idea spread the world over that ‘your truth is different to mine’ is the result of a postmodern disease that started as academic theory but has now captured civilizations – and they don’t even realize where that idea began or how they have become victim to it that is the extent of their ignorance but you hardly meet a man who says he doesn’t know he’s right with regards to what i would want the end result to be i wouldn’t risk going through a major operation unless i would feel more confident afterwards right now i don’t feel comfortable without my shirt on so if an operation

soviet union people in america understand at least in principle the value of freedom liberty self determination and self responsibility as americans we have the narrative of the constitution to fall

takes us back to those dilemmas from our teens cool people seem to be effortlessly cool people trying to be cool are inherently uncool so how do you make yourself look cool without looking like you’re trying to make yourself look cool the risk of ridicule if you get it wrong is gutknotting to me it struck me as a little odd that the military would be helping in what comes off a recruitment video while obama is publicly saying he’s going to try and slash the budget to reduce the military to what would be an anemic level i thought that since the military brass probably had some inkling that his proposed cuts were coming then the generous level of help in this video was a not so subtle cue to obama that it is our troops not drones and computers that make this the best fighting force in the world but obama would have to live in reality to realize that…it also comes off as a bit of slap to people like rick santorum who think women have no place in the military and should just stay home barefoot and pregnant i still say santorum should try that line about women not being fit for combat to the face of any armed female member of the military and see how long he lasts our babies arrived

punished for the informed decision they make said dr mercola like any drug or medical procedure a doctor recommends getting a vaccine is a personal health choice and the voluntary consent of the patient is absolutely necessary thus when a man come to the end of his days belloc thinks on the downward slope where he sees the marble tomb he sees on either side of him these two companions follies and sins they talk to him continually he says to himself in my words oh no of that folly and god forgive me of that sin our follies and our sins need to be reckoned with if we do not we should make very poor wayfaring with them at the end when we do come to the end we notice that we have lost the other friends and fellowships what we have left are our follies and our sins we even strike up a conversation with ourselves belloc thinks good morning my dear folly number then he feels his sleeve being pulled for attention and responds goodmorning sin number remember me to all the little sins this should really be called crock pot chicken a million ways because there are seriously endless uses for this chicken but these are the ways i used it look at the genealogy of jesus christ it is

lot of cooking as well especially for vegetables i think the juice and zest gives everything just enough sour and a good bite in chicken dishes and can even be made nice and sweet if used with sugar like lemon meringue pie so it’s pretty versatile too same with the oranges orange juice always in my house one of the common objections to the christian view of salvation especially in its reformed

entry is taken is “to the virgins to make much of time ” of course from my perspective it is little more than an earlier century’s version of a young man trying to get a young woman into bed however the line “gather ye rosebuds” when not necessarily applied in this context can be quite apt in describing my nowphilosophy of life as i am now middle aged i pay more attention to the commercials and books and other media which tell you to plan for retirement to sacrifice to hold back that much more percentage of your pretax paycheck for your “golden years’ i am planning of course for retirement but i also realize the harsh reality that today might be my last day on this planet and that none of us is guaranteed those years of freedom from work this is a very futureoriented society we are told we can have x y or z when we grow up and the we must wait for the promotion the house the vacations people who live in poor and desperate circumstances are often criticized by the middle classes for being too “presentoriented” however that is the only way one can be when one is in survival mode and often surrounded by dangers there is neither a right nor wrong to it yet it is a huge mistake not

is right and best for that young person writing is something i have always wanted to do—i wrote my first book when i was seven—but it wasn’t until i retired that i found the time to devote to it at a serious level even then it wasn’t quite as simple as knocking off a book in one go for it took me over twenty drafts and i pushed through the bushes after sophie sophie the thought froze me solid in the middle of the bush did i really think the large feline that had crawled through these bushes minutes ago was the same cat that had been mine as a child the same sophie who had slept curled on my

wearing just a nappy so i guess the idea of starting to play around with ideas is that by xmas i will have the perfect invite for the perfect wedding recently i've been kind of consumed with the idea of going back to my first crafting dream of bookbinding if you've been reading this drivel for years you may remember that i made some early attempts not long after we'd moved to tiny town in an attempt to find something to occupy my time while job hunting and learning french you can see some of my finished books here i felt kind of stuck because i knew i wasn't doing most of right but i was having trouble figuring out where to go from there i usually don't do well learning on my own and prefer the help of a tutor but i wasn't getting anywhere so eventually i dropped it and picked up knitting much to my bank account's chagrin i kind of just threw together what we had lying around we're headed out of town again so it was a last ditch effort to clear out the refrigerator it was either this or the six pack of guinness and a triple stacked baloney sandwich at this point in the conversation last night i mentioned that i had a ton of respect for a movie starring jodie foster called the brave one her boyfriend is killed in a mugging and most of the movie is about her dealing with this trauma to the point of getting a gun illegally and exacting vigilante justice kinda like batman but without the main character growling every line so we decided to have everyone sleep in our room in fear that they would have all the presents unwrapped before we woke up in the morning after this we started to have our practice and she told us she’ll treat us today at lunch time kamsahamnida seonsaengnim proving that i've been treasure hunting in the wrong place my entire life

starbucks table filipinos are mostly brown skinned but there are a variety of shades from mocha light brown to sunbathed dark brown to almost black but not enough to look like african ebony there are even some filipinos who look almost like fairskinned foreigners because they have fairskinned ancestors our colonial masters the americans the spaniards and the japanese are nations where the fairer ones were once or in certain respects still remain dominant powerful and privileged compared to these highminded concerns the questions at issue in the québec case canada procureur général c charbonneau qccs might be rather pedestrian at least it does not appear from the judgment that the federal government or the rcmp are opposed as a matter of principle or policy to québec’s inquiry into the shady dealings in its construction industry and that industry’s unsavoury links with the provincial government might this change if the inquiry uncovers links between that industry and the federal government as a report by the globe mail suggests it well may but given the sheer volume of the information it is asked for the rcmp is probably concerned about the costs of complying with the request as it is with preserving the secrecy of its inquiry methods and sources the court however suggests that these concerns are overstated andor capable of being addressed by the rcmp’s cooperation with the commission of inquiry and with provincial police as for the constitutional position the court holds that a commission of inquiry set up pursuant to provincial law can validly subpoena the rcmp and request information in its possession so long as it does not inquire about the rcmp’s administration the rcmp as the supreme court has held is not part of the civil service and does not enjoy the same immunities from provincial inquiries as the federal crown or its servants application form how could i allow nearly months slip by i have knitted a ton and been busy taking pics etc i vow to get caught up over the next week or so and stay on top of it but the byc showed me that joshua could have given up when he became a slave in the house but he didn’t he could have given up when he became a prisoner after being falsely accused but he didn’t he kept growing he was persistent in his faith with god and obeyed him and i’m sure there were times he did want to give up it also taught me that we have to wait patiently for god i originally made plans to commit to be here for two years but after the byc i started to question if two years was enough if not for the bcm but dc i realized that god has plans for me and sometimes i’m just scared to admit that i need more time to grow and be more faithful but i need to be like joshua and wait patiently for things to happen even if it means becoming a slave somewhere or thrown in jail because of false accusations i doubt that would happen that way oppression here is definitely one of those things in the deaf community but everything happens for a reason remember this i have come to the conclusion that i have the best dreams when i get hours of sleep i’m on spring break this week and man does it feel good to sleep in back to the subject of dreams—you know you’re a writer when you dream about your characters i’ve gotten some really good ideas from dreams for instance i dreamed up an entire plotline about a princess and pirates and their adventures on the high seas which i’ve since changed and incorporated into what i hope will oneday be a bestselling book series last night i dreamed about one of my characters giving another character a serious talk about dating his sister you think of the weirdest things when you dream dreams are very key to stories though a character could either have some kind of revelation in a dream have a vision that is a very serious plot twist or be visited by some supernatural force one of my characters well actually a few but i’m mostly focusing on one has visions from time to time that she can’t control you can more or less count that as a dream her dilemma is whether or not to act on her visions and as i’m sure we’ve all figured out by now trying to change the future is usually what makes the event you’re trying to avoid happen coughcoughstarwarscoughcough the british adventure in asia and africa is the stuff of novels and films romantic and exotic but americans never truly went in for living among the natives and staying for the long term the american way has almost always been to look for quick money and then move on having said that we are going to see the black keys on saturday with friends which i'm really excited about but i do feel like a total mom these days when it comes to concert going i swear i used to be really cool and do things like that all the time between kfog and mr jones to keep me up on good music i'm trying my best to at least act like a cool kid we sure love you that afternoon after school found me in my father’s office at the palace i burst into his office without knocking and then flopped down on a chair interrupting a conversation between him and his top economic advisor i complained “why do i have to study two foreign languages i have a friend who lives on a farm and he doesn’t need to learn any” mr and mrs ian taylor ian is president and chief exec of the world’s largest oil trader vitol donations it’s

from our society final thoughts love my boys so much over the course of recent decades the corrupt system of appointing the very people engaged in the crimes they are appointed or hired to prevent has accelerated beyond all reason it is obvious at this point that the officials put in charge of hiring and appointing are picking individuals with a pathological mindset for the very worst behaviors in this diseased age whether it is dhs tsa child protection services or any of the gamut of bloated and useless government agencies they are specifically hiring criminals perverts troglodytes serial sexual psychopaths and serial killers for the very reason that they are what they are there is no hyperbole or exaggeration here that is how it is i had pointed out that even the anticatholic writer

due to the use of avandia for months is between and the best estimate being in other words avandia does seem to increase the risk of heart disease but the studies have been small so the precise

proven to be one of the better gauges of sentiment that i have seen here is a look over the past years the keys to look for when looking for a major top are bulls at less than and bullbear ratios over for at least a few weeks while one shouldn’t rely on this indicator alone it has been quite useful i want to start with mid and work forward the market made an initial peak in july before a nasty correction into august the bullbear ratio was over for close to months straight and bearish readings were below in october the bullbear ratio had a big two week spike and bulls moved below once again that ended up being the top of the bull run from march october after the peak sentiment fell off a cliff and never really recovered until late the bullbear ratio spent about months up near and bearish readings were clearly under the market then saw a correction in january of or so now look to april ahead of the “flash crash” bullbear readings were up near and bearish sentiment was under now look at the peak in april the bullbear ratio was over for the better part of months before that high and actually spiked up to right before the peak at that time bearish sentiment was once again under now look at where we are today last week was the first time since april that the bullbear ratio came close to and bearish sentiment is still these are not the kind of numbers one would expect near a major

westbrook is playing just poorly enough recently to make us all think that he might not be the best partner to pair with kevin durant again in the month of april westbrook is shooting from the floor in the last five games he is from the floor not exactly the numbers you want to see from your second option especially when his shot selection indicates a first option mentality having said all of that the thunder have maybe the most talented roster top to bottom they certainly have grown over the past couple years something just tells me that they are still a year away from knocking down the next two teams on our list… why does russell have real in quotation marks followed by information that says the seminoles are descendants of displaced tribes she is also collapsing a lot of history into a toosmall period and then she says her family and the indians of the area are all the same that's unsettling it is a bold attack on the sovereignty of the tribes who were there legs these are incredible backtoback actions – working in behalf of the bankers who wrecked the world economy and then voting to withhold help from families impoverished by the bankers’ criminal incompetence you’d think the constituents of some of these senators would catch on but con men like saxby chambliss of georgia take it for granted that they can get away with murder and they do all they have to do is lie about it sure the mass media will also report what the liars’ adversaries say about an issue but the two sides will be presented as though they’re both valid arguments even in instances when two minutes of google research would expose the unassailable truth aye then shall the dark brothers what the fbi didn’t tell us about the hotel malware threat – do you use the internet in hotels when travelling abroad do you think it’s safe to do so the fbi thinks you should be careful but is being surprisingly coy about the details snaking conduits of slick poison author shannon greenland it was one of these modernworld 'chats' which didn't involve any speaking merely the tapping of glass screens or plastic keys it's amazing how i don't think twice about calling these 'conversations' any more amazing but also a little bit worrying i think establish a weekly cleaning routine this includes a complete clean of floors doors sheets furniture windowsills and window frames if it can collect dust or potentially grow mold it should be cleaned changing or cleaning your heating and cooling filters is also recommended to improve your indoor air quality you had me at hello “why would i form a trust

don rob bob me marion sailed with us to winter harbor and is not in the photo with no assistance or influence from me she has developed a sarcastic quip about her a while ago i was asked to post up a bio about myself on the i am korean american website this is a website which showcases normal everyday korean americans and tells a little about what they are about i thought it was a great idea and shot up a bio since then i've met quite a few people who've reached out to me since my bio went up and then i realized i didn't actually blog about it so here's a link to my bio today i spent about minutes in the kitchen so let’s return to the starting point of this post february clip no even explained she needs to be exposed to some things and for me i am hoping to find some answers as how not to feel so much resentment i am like a ball of bundled up resentment i think you all know who and what i am talking about without having to go into much details written and credit to susan hu

couldn't decide which one i want so we went to the hostel first and when we came back a few hours later they were already closed but that didn't stop me from coming back next morning i'm not a fan of

promiscuous girl well a host of things have been happening since i've been here last and i will not bore you with my personal life italo calvino is one of those authors – like graham greene – whose works i devoured in my early twenties and haven’t read much since calvino in fact has continued to publish new work regularly since his death in from the bran tub of unpublished and uncollected writings his relatives keep dipping into i think it is safe to say that none of these will overturn the major works if on a winter’s night a traveller invisible cities cosmicomics marcovaldo and so on then there is this book which i recently remembered i didn’t finish first time around this is particularly satisfying because it's been a long road to get to the level of competency i now have i have been doing what is now my main job for roughly three and a half years there are three main books of business that my division deals with and book a is one i've always been well acquainted with as i worked in that unit for about three years but books b and c i've never worked in and i was never trained in them but i've finally gotten the level of knowledge necessary to talk about it with interested candidates so that i can say what we are asking them in terms of review work i also have enough experience finally to be able to speak with potential reviewers and not be nervous these are all physicians some of them arrogant and self important a few who are unabashed about telling me they make in fifteen minutes that happened an anesthesiologist who i inadvertently made feel guilty for

teaching practices therefore the word is received casually if not indifferently as the word of man that is to say without effect perhaps we have been filling up on verbal “junk food” and have dulled our appetites for “real food” by the profusion of much speaking of our own that leaves us sated if not bloated and therefore we suffer malnutrition in the midst of seeming plenty certainly we lack the evidence of growth and change that the word of god should accomplish and we seem fixed in our immaturity and shallowness and as i listened to their stories and laughed at their jokes unlike type where insulin is lacking the primary symptom in t dm is insulin resistance when food is consumed the carbohydrate is broken down into glucose which circulates in the blood before being used for energy or stored as blood glucose levels rise insulin is secreted by beta cells in the pancreas and insulin is what facilitates the exit of glucose from the bloodstream i've written a post about this before because people with t dm are resistant to the action of insulin the levels of glucose in the blood remain higher for longer and more insulin is secreted to try and deal with it so levels of insulin

overly so i blogged over at my writer's group just over a week ago for example and in between getting sucked into everything from family life to bingo on facebook i managed to set aside yesterday afternoon to go through my manuscript in order to submit it today for this year's abna alexandra reese manzari was perfect all ten toes all ten fingers big redding eyes healthy tine lungs seriously strong manzari muscles and cute daddy nose and blue eyes but most of all she was all any parent really wantsa totally healthy baby we were lucky and happy and proud there is nothing more exciting than creating something as wonderful as a child the positive pregnancy testthe first time you hear the heartthe first flutterthe the first kickthe first sonogramthe first time you see their face the

susquehanna bank center but there was life in the old boys yet a tour of england played to sold out crowds in the late s their earlier films started to be shown on television and they began to receive

but they squeezed in another successful tour before strokes felled both laurel and hardy hardy passed away in field greens it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time and to what

volcano which shoots rubber chickens and wrapped gum it was quite a cosmic setup devotees of the church revered the sanyasis the senior monks and nuns of the order of course they revered the ideal that we represented but it was a little too easy to go along with the unspoken charade of being somehow separate and higher than the rest of the world a seductive kind of spiritual arrogance would creep in try as one might to remain humble and to be authentic and real the power of groupthink and the tidal pull of living in close community with those who thought along the same lines made it difficult to think and act differently in other words the voice of the community and the role of monastic would more often than not overshadow and overpower the voice of my own heart which was sublimated to such a degree that i came to consider body mind and even my heart as a kind of enemy something not to be trusted ernie isley walked in front of charleton at that exact moment he yelled

unfortunately reliance on god’s power was implicit in a favorite oxford group expression “sin the problem jesus christ the cure the result a miracle” and even that phraseology should interest those who define alcoholism as sin or those who think that the oxford group could not and did not bring about cures remember my 'sweet' cravings at night that i have mentioned before well tuesday night was one of those nights where i didn't want to have the haagen dazs dulce de leche ice cream in my freezer but wanted an ultra moist cake instead ro hates it when i am still in cooking mode after he gets back home and acts all cute saying its 'together time' and hates it even more if i need to use a blender at in the night so i gave him a choiceshopping and baking is therapeutic for meso if it wasn't baking then it had to be shopping and yes i wanted a prada bag nothing less than that he said shop but do it right nowwhich i obviously couldn't and so i just decided to go ahead and bake i wanted to bake this walnut upside down cake but ro begged and pleaded to bake a chocolate cake instead he is so chocolate biased and he tricked me into making this boring chocolate cake considering i made it in a matter of hr it was nice and spongy and served the purpose but i so don't want to make a boring chocolate cake on my 'bake or shop' day again god hath all life glory goodness blessedness in and of himself and is alone in and unto himself all sufficient not standing in need of any creatures which he hath made nor deriving any glory from them but only manifesting his own glory in by unto and upon them he is the alone fountain of all being of whom through whom and to whom are all things and hath most sovereign dominion over them to do by them for them or upon them whatsoever himself pleaseth in terms of decision processes and style jobs was famous for being a tough micromanager at least where product design decisions are concerned as a fortune magazine article on apple’s culture put it “he’s a corporate dictator who makes every critical decision—and oodles of seemingly noncritical calls too from the design of the shuttle buses that ferry employees to and from san francisco to what food will be served in the cafeteria” keeping it old school i prepared fresh homemade potato latkes potato pancakes for family and friends this past december for the holiday of chanukah or hannukah using a traditional recipe from my wellused cookbook btw those are the best recipes coming from a wornout cookbook i had an extra challenge make glutenfree potato pancakes no problem since i enjoy several glutenfree products and know where the very large supply of glutenfree products are in my market would you like to hear a story with a happy ending a modern day fairy tale as it were the girl stopped

easily ridicule lars for his behavior and some do at first but because everyone cares so much for lars they do whatever they can to help him in this situation they are great people everyone in the film gives a strong and real performance that most movies are unable to achieve as steele wrote “mr obama’s extraordinary dash to the forefront of american politics is less a measure of the man than of the hunger in white america for racial innocence” and “for whites here is the opportunity to document their deliverance from the shames of their forbearers” desensitization surrounding rape and sexual abuse seems to continuously invade our lives – it’s in the tv shows and movies we watch in the songs we listen to and it’s even woven into every day speech as if it weren’t a horrifying crime that affects millions of women and men in the us alone while some may think that a rape joke is harmless or a tv show graphically depicting a sexual assault is just interesting television the prevalence and normalization of sexual violence in our daily lives has very serious consequences namely it furthers the perpetuation of a culture of violence and rape in which the sexual objectification and dominance of women is just the norm interestingly the women all caught my sense of humor in that same response and laughed he did not guys what used to be chapter place value switched places with chapter addition and subtraction facts within no matter what happens in your life some bad things will happen at times and you can do two things sit there in the pain or stand up face the issue and move on with your life the moving on can be really hard for some people they get stuck in the shame guilt pain etc for what ever happen it’s hard to get up when something major happens but believe me when i say this the sun is shining bright somewhere for you to walk towards there is always hope no matter where you go it would be a different matter if we could be reasonably sure that the “spaces of autonomy” could persist and flourish that they wouldn’t just devolve into battlegrounds but graeber doesn’t believe that any more than i do the home is composed of three interlocking pavilionlike structures are you done with that good now go watch all the rest the enneagram describes nine distinct personality typesnine different perspectives on lifenine ways of being in the world the reformer the helper the achiever the individualist the investigator the loyalist the enthusiast the challenger and the peacemaker i'm a seven aka the enthusiast i would highly recommend the book the wisdom of the enneagram by don richard riso and russ hudson to anyone interested in the enneagram at all this was a hot topic on my christine kane retreat last yearand i learned a ton about myself as a result the daily mail has found a new figure of fun in the form of a journalist called samantha brick she writes deliberately provocative articles using headlines like “why do women hate me for being beautiful” “i use my sex appeal to get ahead at work… and so should any woman with any sense” and today’s missive “sorry some women are too ugly for tv” i can’t bring myself to link them i’m afraid so i’ll link to her page on journalisted instead dowd we’re adding jobs and if that continues sweet yearning is the rose we meet on our path an antique chair has held many curled

paths on one path walks the blessed person on the other walks the wicked and if the blessed one never steps foot onto the path of the wicked we can be sure and certain that the wicked person never steps foot on the path of the righteous person the lord watches over the way of the righteous but the way of the wicked it appears not so much since their way will be destroyed as my post on my other

clandestine cake club event i used half the normal quantities to make six rather than twelve individual cakes claire ty’s friend – she’s very secretive full of potential i felt i ‘knew’ her less than any other character i loved having the chance to find out more about her in almost true this the third adaptation from warner bros of hammett’s classic san francisco mystery in just years is clearly the best – though the first version now retitled dangerous female and starring ricardo cortez as a slightly sleazy incarnation of sam spade is well worth rediscovering as a tougher less romantic version of the story this exceptionally close adaptation of the novel features a veritable rogues’ gallery of character actors all seemingly cast to perfection from sydney greenstreet as caspar gutman and peter lorre their first onscreen aspiring as joel cairo while bogart and nancy astor were never than playing the dark and twisted romance of sam spade and brigid o’shaughnessy – wonderful from the novel by dasheill hammett i have refrained from writing about the danish cartoons issue not because it doesn't concern me but rather because too mush has been written about it and i didn't feel like i would be adding something new to the discussion there are so much i could write about r hakohen kook and still feeling that i didn’t tell enough afterwards he indeed was a brilliant mind a great thinker and a role model maybe even more today than then i’m not sure i would be able to do him right though so i’ll rather let you get an understanding of him by his own word i hope that this will be

blackberry or some other type of smartphone and let’s face it – that’s everyone then double texting becomes okay however you must send the texts straight after each other this is okay because your

other day at quilt group the conversation turned to the current rash of reality cooking shows where people try to put on a good meal but are eliminated week by week now i don't know how you all feel but i find shows like that are nasty they are not about the recipes and cooking but more about who can we get rid of this week if we chuck off soandso we might lose viewers because they are on the side of the poor dear but on the other hand we can't chuck off those two nice young blokes because they give the females in our audience something to watch and we don't want to lose our female

this power if a is rolled once per session the player can make up a detail about any dungeon environment the characters find themselves in details may include secret doors passwords codes the location of a pylon or how to operate a pylon the dm should let the player throw their idea out there in one short sentence but then further details are for the dm to determine note that ancient sleestak technology allows for structures that are larger on the inside than the outside and other warping of time and space so dungeon maps need not be modified except to note the location of any new sleestak

lies a tension here between kochan’s perceived true self and his actual true self forming confusion with masks at the heart of it all with a mask hiding his true self and a mask expressing his true self is it possible to clearly define which mask does the hiding and which allows for expression and if both his true self and his false self take the form of a mask is either of them really his “true self” the title confessions of a mask suggests nothing exists beneath the mask the confessions are coming from the mask not from the person beneath the mask can he be his “true self” without a mask

enjoying this more positive and sensitive side to jane but she still hung on to a drop of suspicion as patti was in her closet losing the blouse and skirt peeling away the stockings and trading it all for soft cotton things she caught some of jane’s inner turbine of energy patti remembered when she was in her late teens and the day she could no longer keep the secret that she was pregnant she stayed home from school her mother noted how sick she seemed and there was the obligatory visit to the doctor he found nothing wrong other than fever and a little weight gain and it wouldn’t be until patti confessed the complete story that she and her mother reached the bottom of the relationship abyss before attempting to climb out they never climbed out not a step but patti had sworn that she and her daughter would never fall into such a place and would never need any safety ropes to hoist themselves out so far she and jane had ventured down the slopes a bit but they hadn’t gotten so far down as to lose the light of day but what truly kept nagging me as the film wore on was the question of why i was supposed to be thrilled by the police stomping out these nondescript people in this building i wouldn't call it fascistic per se certainly not in the way that say the elite squad is this is perhaps the one area where the film's lack of story works if it had even a whisper of one it would likely be in support of this police brutality there is something though unsettling about how gleefully the film moves into a brawl especially given that the first building resident the audience

relationship with a man to drive my car and get my stuff out of storage i like to imagine i am better now i no longer dwell on the events of the day try not to conjure up the pictures etched on the back of my closed eyelids for when i do i remember that i have only a fragile grasp on control and even that is held together by the tenuous threads of my logical mind my irrational mind still wants to let go and fall i still want to peel my grasping fingers loose and let my soul take flight i still want to scream i want to hit and hurt i want to scratch my fingers down something soft and yielding i want to bite down hard and feel the blood spurt in my throat as something gives in my teeth i have this caged animal inside of me that is clawing to escape and it is a struggle to keep it quiet ice i tell myself i am ice ice is hard and cold ice feels no pain nor sorrow or anger or fear ice needs no fire to survive and indeed maybe my internal fire needs to be doused so i will feel

those public responses to the da's decision you see i am always weeks behind on reader's spaces since there is so much awesomeness in all of you so when tami sent me her story it was still below

year old steven lamb doesn’t have a lot to be happy about he his brother davey and their mother lettie live with steven’s nan his mother clearly favours davey and his nan is haunted by the loss of her own son billy almost two decades earlier billy was believed to have been a victim of serial killer arnold avery who is now in prison billy’s body was never found and steven has spent a huge amount of time digging to try and find it on exmoor where oher victims of avery were buried but i think i like it at least i wore it out in public a few times so i guess it’s too late now… this kitchen also has

missing before the final act edamame with lemon juice served with a sausage indeed anyone who has tried living in a genuine commune has probably come across at least one example of the phenomenon in question while everyone else is giving to the commune to the best of his ability the freeloader gives as little as possible and almost invariably ends up taking a lot more than he needs because freeloaders are unusually shameless it is pointless to try to shame them into observing the principles underlying the communism of everyday life because by definition the communism of everyday life is an informal system freeloaders cannot be sanctioned by law communism of everyday life conservatives have grown after church on our way home we discussed why we were not celebrating easter the way we normally did i was amazed that the kids were totally fine with the change looking back russell observes several members of the crowd as they rise upward and transform into silvery misty tiny balls

sorbet i actually made this recipe about a month ago in an effort to get ahead but it would really have been a nice treat during the heat wave of the past week the good thing is it's so simple i can make it again without much effort once i figure out how to jam my ice cream canister into my packed freezer that is there are only ingredients milk water sugar and bittersweet chocolate they're boiled on the stove for minutes and once they've been chilled your sorbet is ready to be churned the chocolatemint combo is pretty irresistible to me so i took dorie's suggestion in the playing around section to mix in peppermint extract i waited until i was ready to churn the sorbet mixture before adding the extract and then added it little by little sampling at each step until it had just enough mint flavor for me the afrikaners began to settle in south africa in the th century fleeing religious persecution in europe they established two prosperous states which created job opportunities for

exciting step forward for others it may be a last resort either way some authors are beginning to do very well from it this month's colour challenge is orange pink and aqua once that was done a few more minutes arranging the pitchers done here's my layout “remember me i just love the little bird focal bead in this kit and i wanted to frame that with some of the orange delica beadsso i just started with a raw bezel and then worked a few rounds of peyote to tighten the bezel around the focalthen i just started adding some embellishments so i’ve got an aching back but i’m not sure if that’s from the exercises or just my ongoing back issue or both i’ve also got some sore thighs i know tomorrow is going to be even worse for those but i don’t mind the pain i know it’s because i worked those muscles and they are letting me know it does suck however when you are constantly following a toddler around the house and lifting him up thankfully my little man likes to play independently and give me a break the riot squad signals the truck driver to dump the load i took it out for a trial run this morning while john was at work after too many days off during spring break i was nervous about how i’d feel i didn’t have a milage goal exactly in mind but i did really want to measure a new route i had tried out a few weeks earlier the route turned out to be four miles out and my legs were a tired i kept pushing through knowing that every mile would help mile five felt awesome and was definitely a negative splitmy watch told me i hate when it takes four long miles to get into the run at this point i decided to take a different route home the changeup would get me at least another mile brining me to nine at the end estimating milage from previous routes well at eight miles i decided why nine when i can run an even runners are certifiably crazy ten was difficult but i really wanted a number to help me determine my current pace while going that far i completed miles in i’ll take it opg have also submitted an idea for a fun project to help promote hawaiian music the winners receive for their event and accommodation at an eco hotel in hawaii during the music festival since i’ll be calling at hawaii on my ocean row and want to help promote the international award and links with our guys here in georgia i thought it would be fun to host a hawaiian evening for opg participants and other award participants and youngsters in georgia and also to get them to put some art work or writing together in a scrapbook that i can take with me on my ocean row and present to the children in hawaii hopefully getting them to do the same and bringing that back with me to georgia perhaps even spreading some georgian music and getting the kids from both countries talking to each other via skype anyway we have submitted our idea and voting begins on the th may and if we can get enough votes then we can win and host the hawaiian evening here in tbilisi

before doesn’t mean you have to keep falling down and i can tell you from personal experience by the way that if you get too caught up in the pride and excitement of the leap you will fall when you land i’m not known for my physical grace so if these things are true — and i assure you they are — then why are we so hard on each other and why are we so damned hard on ourselves i am playing along

teacher was a white guy with light brown hair who does that sound like but i took the dream as being about bertram i decided to give him a chance i called up orion and asked him to put us in touch i did get a contact with the new guy and i very frankly described my attitude about associating with him i told him that i had some seriously difficult patients who were not making good progress in their healing and that i could certainly use his help but that i needed to stay in charge of my body and i didn’t want to be pushed around many of the medicinal mushrooms including chaga mushroom

after getting disemboweled because i looked at a walker too long i decided to put the controller down and go to bed it was way after midnight and thus my bedtime i finished the episode up this morning it’s a very interesting idea rather than having controller schemes and buttons to memorize everything is right there on the screen your reticule is actually the four buttons under your thumb when you highlight an object that you can interact with the actions pop up on the reticule to look at something press the top button to use it press the bottom button to use a tool in your inventory conveniently listed to the left of the screen press the left or right button when zombies attack button mash and try to keep the reticule on the walker’s head there are a series of decisions that you have to make i didn’t even realize there was much of a choice until the end of the chapter when it compares your actions to those of the rest of the world it turns out almost everyone is willing to save a little boy over someone else but other decisions are far more equitable sometimes you are forced to choose who you are going to save warning you probably won’t be able to save both sometimes you have to choose who to agree with in an argument sometimes you just have to choose conversation options overall the frantic moments are mixed in well with the calm or depressing moments i will have something with more substance next time promise better than another day in their hands he glanced back towards the doorway his pallor turning his face to stone look there's stuff i haven't told you i

over fill the tart any left over chocolate can be chilled and used to make chocolate truffles thus what the decree and galileo’s abjuration actually addresses is a singular doctrineopinion which includes two points notice that they are connected with the conjunction “and” not “or” viz that the earth moves and that the sun is the immovable center of the universe but as fr olivieri rightly states the modern astronomer does not believe that the sun is immovable nor does he hold it to be the center of the universe reading this decree strictly—that is according to the catholic church’s stated canonical principles see here—it becomes clear that modern views do not fall under this condemnation at all and that was exactly fr olivieri’s point bob is wrong that the earth's motion can be isolated in the way he did a strict interpretation of the decree forbids such selective cropping and he is equally wrong that there was anything untoward about what fr olivieri did in pointing out that according to a strict canonical interpretation of this decree modern views do not fall under the condemnation my brother is in sales and i went to his office one day and saw a sign and loved it it said the hustle is heaven if you’re a hustler the hustle is hell if you’re not place the apples tablespoon of the lemon juice and sugar in a saucepan and gently heat until the apples turn to mush this should take about minutes with the lid on really i had already been teaching myself all of this i researched some other programs across the us but ended up not wanting to leave the bay area how much more do i need to learn maybe i just wasn’t confidant enough to think i could actually start this venture on my own… now its time get ready to receive the blessings to come to begin festivities anew and to start the new year with thoughts of love and prosperity its also time to get out the old to show or sell and bring in the new new friends new inspiration new music and new opportunities to marry art commerce fun when you meditate or abide in your quiet times of communion you do not charge in and do something like saying “i will now be good and move mountains by an act of faith” no you water your garden knowing that these ideas are growing into a heavenly garden the indwelling spirit doeth the work not you you merely water it do you not see the comfort there is in that i can tell you in primer language that a very gentle calm unemotional selfless and patient attitude toward your spiritual growth is essential – such as all old gardeners know they know that patience hoeing watering and a certain order a quiet rhythm bring to birth a heavenly beauty we pass small children looking old before their time as they lead donkeys goats and sheep to new grazing pastures the seven had also refused to fill the vacant seats in the cwc that were reserved for them later that evening terpil explained that one of the guests on the barge was carlos ramirez known to police throughout the world as ”the jackal” – the international terrorist believed to be responsible for planning the olympics massacre in munich a deadly raid on the fiumicino airport in rome and numerous aircraft hijackings there was no photograph of ramirez in existence terpil told mulcahy the ”wanted” posters on display at airports throughout the world contained only a composite drawing terpil also told mulcahy that ramirez was living in barracks no at the former wheelus united states air force base in libya terpil seemed awed by ramirez who was accompanied at the party by sayad qaddafi chief of libyan intelligence identified by terpil as qaddafi’s cousin and the second most powerful man in libya mulcahy was now in far too deep and he knew it it was late august and john harper and other wilsonterpil employees were at work in tripoli setting up the munitions laboratory for terrorist bombs and a training program for their effective use wilson and terpil made it clear to mulcahy that they did not want him to go libya mulcahy kept his now grave doubts to himself and continued on his business trip moving on to copenhagen and another series of meetings terpil returned to libya and he and wilson suddenly dispatched an urgent cable to copenhagen mulcahy was to break off his trip and return to washington to open negotiations there with the general dynamics corporation for the purchase of one of its redeye groundtoair missiles general dynamics had advertised in trade journals that it had l redeyes for sale to legally acceptable buyers the missile which could not be exported to libya under the law is shoulderlaunched and has a heatseeking component that enables it to track and destroy aircraft in flight it had been used extensively and successfully by the israelis during the war ”my problem was not to worry about the paperwork” mulcahy says ”terpil and wilson had a pilot in pennsylvania who would fly anywhere once he got over the water” – and away from american legal jurisdiction – ”he would change the paper” if the red eye had been purchased the pilot would simply change the intended recipient listed on the export license from an approved ally such as those in nato for example to libya i usually love phillipa's writing it isn't factual it's got loose facts but mostly all scandal and intrigue but this one was too hard to follow and a little on the boring side which is odd since this was a rewrite of the war of the roses lancsters vs yorks and i really loved the white queen which is the sister book i think because the white queen was sorta witchy and the red queen was more religious that i found the other side more interesting however i think it's important to read both because they really fo answer to each other’s stories and it's always fun to hear both sides one thing i did like was margaret’s perseverance and her stubbornness i love a woman who is mischievously resourceful lorena saidwow tara fantastic give away prizes i adore sweet tooth

although i didn't have the opportunity to take a look at my fev on the same machine a few weeks ago because i didn't have a clinic appointment i do believe my home machine correlates pretty closely to my clinic machine i'm going there no more to roam the amount of booking requests and the money i could make if i went full time keep rolling around in my head for all my liberal hippy bullshit labour views and commie leanings i find the thought of making that much money exciting i keep daydreaming about that flat in london about lazy days spent being this exciting mysterious person that i could never actually bebut i want it i want to disappear home keeps calling and all my conversation is vague and evasive i don’t want to think about them right now the responsibility of being loved i don’t want it i talked to my dad this morning and he said he missed me he never says stuff like that the feeling’s mutual but i don’t want to do anything about it just stay missing stay missed so selfish

cutandpaste aspect many mainstream wiccan authors sell and you know that’s what originally turned me off and away from wicca specifically the cutandpaste aspect but i realize that i had been reading some pretty bad authors namely silver ravenwolf who had promoted this aspect there really isn’t anything wrong with being open with readers about who or what is worshipped – hell if you perform a ritual out of a book you’re likely to insert your deityies anyways which i understand is expected but wicca is a religion in and of itself unlike witchcraft and though it isn’t as concrete as christianity or other religions some theoalogy is recognized like the duality and polarity of the god and goddess magick wiccan rede etc i would love to hear more from you about this do you think

from the formal dining room it was at this point my mind flashed to the gopher in caddy shack were the squirrels out to get us upon further investigation we discovered a squirrel running around the skylight area and back and forth across the rafters we tried to encourage it to leave but the high whistling sound continued it was obvious the little guy was in distress for some reason we assumed it couldn’t figure out how to leave until the international man of intrigue went to the other side of the dining room for a better look and discovered another squirrel hovered in the doorway it had either fallen or climbed down and couldn’t get back up the international man of intrigue walked softly closer speaking in a calm voice assuring the little squirrel he was only going to open the door so it could go back outside too bad she wasn’t buying it she darted across the dining room as he opened the door luckily she seemed young and confused and didn’t hide so she was quickly herded back

one of the best things about this book is the characters i loved them especially allison zeke and kanin except for that part where the coyotes will leave phoenix for quebec city… written by joseph ray daniel stephens alana watson servings and you know…i’m a malcolm x chick it’s funny that thomas jefferson abe lincoln all these generals have these beautiful monuments and history shows although important to history they were all racist and i know times were different but does that make it right or does that make it right that we leave that out when discussing them cause i’m a malcolm x chick i think his monument should be on the national mall down the way from mlks and let me tell you exactly why… i don’t want to go into too many specifics of what malcolm x did for black people… …but in general terms malcolm x stood up for black people and saidi am brilliant too if you hit me i will hit you back why because we are equal we are the same instead of peace marches and nonviolence malcolm before his death was ready to go to the united nations and bring human rights crimes against the united states to him it was a global problem…even when the world turned its back do you realize america was condemning apartheid in south africa and not doing anything about racism at home smh… malcolm was about to basically sue the us for racism in international court how brilliant is that… …but this is not why we should have a statue of him to me see…mlk he was “perfect” in the public eye a saint an alien of moral character an angel and thomas jefferson and the generals and abe and all these men that ran the country but were racists but got marble statues… none of those people changed mlk was always perfect honest abe’s story will always lie and say he freed the black man thomas jefferson raped slave women these men did not change angel or racist pig…they did not change malcolm changed he went from calling white people devils to saying ‘i was wrongmy brothers are white black yellow and red’ as significant figures go…he was the only one that seems real…that evolved…that changed his view on race but we don’t honor that… we’d rather throw up a statue of a dude that signed some papers but would never sit next to someone darker than him that makes sense cigarette butts are ‘toxic time bombs’ containing significant pollutants that can harm wildlife and damage coastal environments they can take up to five years to break down in sea water and cost management authorities thousands of dollars each year to pick up i would then ask the doi and doe setting a dividing line which could be the median or the average – whichever is lower – of existing wages and our negotiating position every time a contract came for renewal would be determined by whether the wage scale open for negotiations is above or below that line our policy would be to bring the pay scales closer and fact finding would be our best tool in achieving that goal ff would only help those unions below the line this evening was a case in point we skyped with my sister and it became clear that my parents had been in touch with her by text and email during their visit here sharing stories they thought were funny and which i just considered everyday happenings the following story which i was a part of was told back to me and blow me if it didn't seem a great deal funnier in the retelling than it had whilst i was in the middle of it this cover was released on the soundtrack for the oftforgotten james cameronpenned strange days a marvellous cyberpunk film starring ralph fiennes juliette lewis starts as a wannabestar and performs two tracks in the movie shown below if you can track down both the film and the soundtrack as both are fantastic san diego the concept lends itself to almost unimaginable amounts of innuendo and toilet humor and its great humor with loads of suggestion and excellent gags that all our main girls are different kinds of assault rifles is one thing but when you start going over what parts of their body equate different parts of a gun it starts to get a bit outlandish it is the subtle and sometimes notsosubtle suggestions that helped to make this episode hilarious all the way through and the second thing is that a couple of people have contacted me to say that they are judges for the folk awards and were very happy to see my blog posts so i was thinking that if there are any other judges out there who'd like to out themselves in the name of transparency since the bbc and smooth operations agree that there has never been anything preventing them from doing this you could email me here and if there is a decent sized handful i could write a separate post about what the folk awards look like from that point of view i then cut the front layers by using pattern paper and the negative from the first bag cut as a template where to place my pattern paper after that was cut i hand trimmed all the pieces inch smaller and glued them onto the bag i cut the cherries from hello kitty greeting's and stamped the faces with peachy keen's cornie's faces the tag was cut from winter frolic and i attached it to the bag with some decorative fiber to finish i added a strip of lace to the bottom of the bag added a ribbon handle and added a layered flower to the center flap with a brad i also added a velcro dot to the flap to close the bag and the sentiment was stamped from whimsical designs whimsical fun vol most obviously the lucky lab beers are hoppy even those without a lot of bitterness have layered hop character starting with the

wanted the images to be therapeutic while using readily available supplies and producing the images as simple as possible there are things i could do to rectify this mostly they involve ripping back

aspect of baking i like the fact that i can give away the things i make it's hard to cook well for one person and i get tired of having to invite people over all the time besides who wants to come

step on the road to discovering yourself as a writer” and starts the next chapter on the assumption that you already know what it is you’re going to write but to my great horror i realized i have no

and hot and rather itchy on the skin i'm kind of picky about salad i hate iceberg lettuce it's void of any flavor in my opinion isn't quite as nutritious as it's pretty dark green cousins or red ones for that matter and frankly it's boring no wonder i don't love salad iceberg ick for years salad meant pasty looking iceberg lettuce to me no my mom who is an amazing cook didn't forcefeed us iceberg but it's just what i associated salad with as i've learned to expand my definition of salad i've become a bigger advocate of them you'll see perusing any salad recipes i post many don't even have lettuce in them but iceberg is definitely not featured here this salad is no exception a few weeks back i was getting head after head of cabbage in my farmhouse delivery boxes green napa red you name it i got it so i made slaw a lot i wouldn't call this a slaw since i feel like slaw is another one of those terms with not so pretty connotations but i'd say it's a cabbage salad instead by years of

thirdly mentioned was my tour guide for the parks experience last summer my boyfriend his second home is yellowstone he knows where to eat where to camp the names of the specific animals and i mean individually the sites that are mustsees and when to go when no one is around perfect fit me thinks well the weekend went on as normal… cartoons… playing … saturday at life church… playing… bed time around pm … sunday at frontline… home to get ready for white water… things don’t always go the way you expect do they as we were getting ready micah and silas came in from the back yard looking pale as a ghost and ran into mommy then i hear shanna say “chewy is dead what i thought “i knew this was going to happen she said my heart sank surely he is not dead i went into the back yard and saw him hanging there “i knew this was going to happen” she said “be quiet shanna” i said “what can i do” i thought “there must be something i can do” silas was in bed sobbing… micah was standing behind me barley crying with a shocked look on his face… asher seemed totally normal and was saying “he’s not dead i saw him moving” “there was nothing i could do” he was dead right in front of me i had put him on a tie out the day before because he had dug out and escaped i was only going to keep him on it until i got some bricks and dirt to fill the hole so he could not get out again 'now he is dead' he had tied himself up and fought so hard that he had cut his own throat 'he was the best dog i ever had now my children will never see him again in this life' me and shanna decided we needed to go to white water so the children could get their mind off of it within a few minutes my dad was on his way to get chewy to bury him as i was getting into the van the lord showed me what a mistake i was making so i told the boys “come with me so we can say goodbye” we walked into the back yard and walked up to his lifeless body and i prayed “god thank you for chewy then the boys prayed everyone was in tears except asher asher was bouncing on the trampoline still in denial then we all spoke to chewy and told him how much we loved him that is the day of my last deadline at school for this semester when my father first told me he didn’t believe in a god i found that absolutely unimaginable i had never doubted god’s existence for even a moment i have felt the power surge of the spirit there’s an

significant just waiting to be released out of that space between the six and the nine put it this way if you ever wanted to cross over that gap if you ever wanted to see what it was like on the other side you would need to change your entire life and get rid of almost everything else our second entrance in as many days through the doorway of the farmhouse proved to be a lot more ordinary than my imagination had fancied it might be and the notion that someone may have actually taken up residence in that ramshackle pile of sticks was quickly put to rest on second look at the conditions of the old house and the likeliness that anyone attempting to climb up the flight of stairs leading to the attic would most likely crash through the rotted wood and break a leg or worse we stood listening in silence for what seemed like an eternity but what was most likely a few minutes nothing no sounds except for the occasional crack of the old blackened wood settling we decided that since we had come this far we were damned if we were going to leave without a good and thorough search and so we set about the task of figuring out a way to ascend the steps leading to the attic and is matted on circles punched from the circle punches as well as the scallop circle punch again inside i have the envelopes this time very vanilla social media monitoring has played a large role in the growth and vitality of the community the inner circle team created a series of alerts using social media monitoring software by vendor radian the team tracks company mentions comments and customer passion and regularly identifies and reaches out to nonmembers to invite them to the community they also use radian to keep tabs on regular commenters on twitter and i have to agree with him especially with regards to the light heartedness of the book beckett can be funny yes but it’s a certain kind of humour and it often goes over the heads of people perhaps because his protagonists are often octogenarians if they can even remember their ages and seem to exist outwith a time and place that most of us can relate to there’s not one of us who hasn’t been sick in bed and that’s a very familiar place to start off with this book is not beckettlite or even joycelite it is its own thing even if it’s not ashamed of its influences the way in which we’re spending—largely without thinking—has fueled the “economy of crap” as amy calls it check out amy’s thoughtprovoking post entitled the harbingers of decline companies produce more and more stuff that adds no value to our lives and eventually ends up in landfills the environment is more polluted and ravaged of resources consumer debt rises and the only ones who gain are corporations and wall street style doppelbock strengthen your resolve release of your funds which has been delayed by this dubious officials i don’t know about perfect pitch but i wouldn’t be surprised if there is something a bit atypical about the way our brains process sounds the enjoyment of music is very important to a number of people in our family which i’m sure has something to do with the temporal lobes a lot of the music that we enjoy is sung in nonenglish languages languages from all corners of the world i’m not sure how unusual our taste in music is but there does seem to be a hunger in our family for listening to exotic phonemes none of us are language savants like the famous british synaesthete daniel tammet but there is a consistent line of descent in our family of bilingual or multilingual people i also seem to have a thing about unusual voices i choose to have people in my life who have unusual voices and i love to listen to distinctive singing voices of a range of types for me singing voices are easily categorized as interesting or not interesting and i much prefer the former the gravelvoiced rap singers everlast and tone loc have interesting voices and so do all countertenors i recently read an interesting observation about the extraordinary sound of the countertenor voice in a newspaper interview article about german countertenor andreas scholl “i think these days the audience knows what a countertenor is but it’s that inability to readily categorise the voice that makes for better communication – you listen with fresh ears and focus more on the words” i believe this is an important element of my enjoyment of the voices of countertenors and other singers with interesting voices the strangeness of the sound draws attention closely finely and it also destroys any set of simple musical expectations i find strange sounds compelling and interesting and i’m not sure why i find this so very enjoyable but i do know from experience that when people enjoy doing anything involving thought they are most likely utilizing some particular area of cognitive strength in many fields professionals say you need to log hours to become an expert for new teachers that can take about five years and those first five years are often the most challenging… read the full story here visiting elephant sands again for work we found the waterhole very full of water although not experiencing so many

was specifically the use of magic as an excuse to not explain things the sort of silly play whereby the doctor survives things or accomplishes things simply because he is the doctor it is an assertion that the doctor’s mercurial powers must function materially now that he must not simply destabilize the world but work his way through it using language and observation and play within the system to dismantle it the doctor’s magic must be advanced magic indistinguishable from technology based on the play within a system and rules and the ambiguities and gaps of that system if ethnic tourism is

shooting the breeze catching up and sipping delicious beer but i bet it's a lot better in the evening with a full crowd they checked me and got me set up to push with a knotted sheet for me to hold onto as i pushed i was to pull myself up using the sheet i was pushing for less than an hour when i began crowning i could feel ears and a nose on the sides of the head and seconds later shai's head was out the rest of her body slipped from me in a rush and suddenly i had a tiny struggling goo covered baby on my chest my spouse was beside me in tears telling me how much zie loved me and how

got all over the steak and the asparagus bed it was served on and made everything sort of frenchyasian in that fun jeangeorges way a wonderful time was had by the both of us made even better by the

to the relation of john asked philip whence bread was to be found for them that can be true which matthew here relates that the disciples first prayed the lord to send the multitudes away that they might buy food from the nearest towns suppose then that after these words the lord looked upon the multitude and said what john relates but matthew and the others have omitted and by such cases as this none ought to be perplexed when one of the evangelists relates what the rest have omitted it is never preferable to take an animal’s life in this situation if avoidable with regard to this bear

and almost two months since i last blogged “a thorn in the flesh”… the word “thorn” means “bodily annoyance” the bodily annoyance was the demon satan sent the thorn was not god’s angel… it was a devil’s angel the lord does not bodily annoy his people did you read that the lord does not bodily annoy his people notice the phrase “the messenger of satan”… the word “messenger” as used here is from the word “aggelos”… especially an “angel”… by implication a pastor paul was buffeted by people too… as well as by demoniacs… update links but today is for me my parents are visiting my sister in chicago this weekend so i have the house to myself which is so awesome but i want to be sure that i don’t just sit on my ass all weekend i need to thoughtful in doing things that i get energy from so this morning i went to the grocery store and paid bills doesn’t energize me but it’s nice to have those done and checking things off the todo list does energize me now i’m drinking my coffee and

somewhere with one of those in hand we were also served a small plate of different appetizertype dishes prosciuttowrapped prawn slice of local beef and a cucumberwrapped slice of ahi tuna with a wasabi sauce all three of which were mighty tasty the craft we tried was kind of a bust and the kids weren't big fans i figured that because the kids love oobleck so much that cloud dough would be a hit we couldn't seem to blend it well enough for it to be able to be formed and just mixing it wasn't nearly as cool as i thought it would be no photos of this one today either sorry “fitness has

baseball once he does a once around the league adjustments will be made and he'll be revealed for the true quality of player he is depending on whether he can adjust to those adjustments himself what is clear is something is going to give because the stress of liberal positions will lead to profoundly illiberal politics some of my friends who are hegelian marxists would call this regression in history but i think this is regression to the mean and a conservatism to maintain it which of course actually undoes the attitude that enabled it over the years i can honestly say that i wasn't a crafter dictated by the season until i turned my craft love into a business before i made whatever i wanted whenever and in whatever color suited my fancy i have to admit though that back then i was mostly making baby blankets but when i became an official business i started trying to keep up with the times just like clothing stores if you expect to have fall items ready at the brink of fall you

the weekend i was discussing the process with a very senior member of the previous administration observing in my own inimitable style that the mentoring scheme is crap always was crap always will be crap a very expensive and stupid waste of money and by now a demonstrable failure from the university of calgary in and phd in geochemistry from the university of calgary jon’s areas of specialization include physical hydrology and hydrogeology environmental forensics water supply and waste disposal and risk assessment jon’s skills also extend to assessing the effects of climate change and land use on basin hydrology and developing effective management strategies for water sustainability in addition to his company duties jon sits on the board of directors for the bow river basin council a water planning and advisory council under alberta’s water for life strategy and serves as chair for the modelling and monitoring committee which makes me wonder who put together this website and who at the

um group at pm er sorry hehehe which lasted for minutes then we went to the commisarry first time which is the army grocery store great prices by the way and to the px we looked around a little longer than we probably should have and had to rush to get home in time to pick up the big kids so i've been doing my horror movie homework lately the first two friday the th movies and the first nightmare on elm street i'd've hit up the halloween series too but the first movie is gone from netflix insty and h o sequel isquite quite dreadful i watched it out of desperation on cable once when i was sick even my massive childhood crush on jamie lee curtis couldn't make it good it only made it watchable i then sat down with the uberbloggers and the beauty reps commenced telling us about their products encouraging me to massage them into my face i have to confess i can’t remember what the products were or what they did because i was too busy sneaking sideways glances at ‘the mrs woog’ nicole farhi charlotte brogues brown thomas € once charlotte’s hearing was covered by music the officer leaned a little closer to john “i got a call about a woman being held in a motel seemed like an abduction also some shots fired the guy in the trunk was heading in that direction not in the direction of the bus so maybe the other two guys are holding your friend in the motel” so many times i resolve to get to bed at a decent time that i cannot make up for all my failures from the day in the night time and even worse so i make the next day worse from staying up late and frantically trying to make or do something that i should have been trying to do throughout the day and god bless tennessee truly i do love that place and there is aways a moment where we cross the border and i know i'm home again oh sure the landscape is the familiar rocky hills i grew up with and the accent is sweet and twangy but what really makes it feel like home are the billboards since we come in from virginia to the east we pass close to gatlinburg and pigeon forge and if you know anything about those places you'll know that they are the craziest tourist trap towns in the entire southern us and much of the um attractions are devoted to how shall i say the indigenous culture of the east tennessee hills hillbillies in other words even when i was growing up and we would vacation there every year back before dolly opened her wood and before the place really took off there was a miniature golf course called hillbilly golf it's still there but apparently they're too hillbilly for a website now they have those big dinner arena things like medieval times but with feuding lumberjacks every other billboard for miles was for lumberjack feud and then there was one for moonshine somebody got the bright idea to legally distill and sell corn liquor in mason jars and i'm cursing like a—well like me—as we pass these magnificent roadside advertisements because i can't just whip out my camera and get a picture of them for you i love it that i get hate mail when i make fun of my redneck brethren and yet tennesseeans are exploiting it themselves left and right many countries have step up measures to combat corruptions with many being successful and others gain support by their own regime very much to mercy of the innocent ones bundling large projects with self interest siphoning of public funds are common sights in many countries some wealthy ones protected by their powerful colleagues became richer whistle blowing remains rhetoric most of the time because those in power are accomplice to the

happening in our street some parts of town had no rain at all there is a low hill between here and the rest of the town which seems to be the dividing line rain falls on one side of the hill but not the other on monday it was obviously our turn while a couple of days ago the other side of the hill had their turn in yesterday afternoon's storm quite a bit of hail fell here i wonder what they had in town we are only a few kilometres away from the centre of town but there is that hill faber i have been arguing that you are better off in physical gold than in gold miner stocks for a variety of reasons and when looking at gold stocks we need to distinguish between exploration companies and producing companies the problem with the exploration companies is that a lot of them will have financing difficulties and they will have to cut down on exploration they may not get financing at all if you have exploration companies to of them could easily be out of business i got a call on friday from rd’s hr rep they want their stuff back big surprise eh so i am to come in tomorrow morning to “exchange” things company property for personal property the only joy i take in this is that our group manager is the one who has to sift through all my boxes and try to identify what is mine ha that should take him a while i took most of my stuff when i left since i am notorious for leaving piles of paper all over my desk he ought to be having fun right about now of course i wonder if this means i will get back my bottles of halfdrunk water ha ha ha yes jack is on the crack it started innocently enough a rawhide here and there to keep him busied when i don't have the time to cover him with smooches or scratch his belly while we watched the real housewives together nothing fancy

needing to and also it is a time thing when i decide to go grocery shopping i make a list and go but this show really demonstrated that i could be doing better just taking a few minutes a week i could at least look at the store sales and the coupons that come weekly in the mail even saving a few dollars a week would add up “i wish i knew what happened judging by the reviews they garnered on both sides of the atlantic both demon and shadow should have done very well but in fact sales of both have been patchy at best but in reality nobody knows what makes one book succeed commercially and another fail i suspect that if there is any one explanation it is perhaps that the setting of my stories is too strange for many readers and that what i thought of as one of their strengths the absence of any modern western perspective was actually seen by many potential readers as a turnoff “ i am not sure i am going to make it to master lets out a small chuckle and quickly thrusts more

nice surprise on friday night he took me to see bon iver rd row center hells yesand it was sorta a perfect night in all the ways you hope for we stopped at our favorite spot to get some wine and a bite to eat two seats at the bar were open we drank delicious sancerre ate mussels steak tartare and a little cheese plate then we headed downtown we parked the car took a walk past the place we shared our first kiss nineplus years ago and headed over to spreckels theater we walked in just as bon iver was going onstage show was amazing plus they played almost every song from their first album which of course is how i fell in love with them in the first place the only slight disappoint i had was that i was sending them esp messages like crazy to play my favorite cover ever but my frequency must have been off usually when i try that hard things come through for me in the great serenade of things know that an envious and jealous person evening rehab kettlebell then dab on the leather and the flower again wait as instructed and then place the flower on the ring i commit to myself to only start considering the practical aspects of participation in this world where i let go of my preoccupation in my mind with unnecessary thoughts based on fears and desires just a quick heads up that we are again putting on a beer and food matching evening with a little twist this time each of the beers will be from the newly established brecon brewing and each of the dishes will involve cooking with beer or cider in one example the scary bit is i'll be cooking instead of taking part this

sheesh but free is free now i know better while i still buy groceries primarily based on the circular i’ve come to realize that a simple nofrills approach to couponing nets good money for little time investment i don’t freak out i don’t buy rainbowcolored faux food and i save a couple hundred bucks each year not too shabby accepting the premise that it's ludicrous to pretend to comprehensively cover the themes of perhaps the most important turning point in our nation's history in minutes we do try to talk about what we think was lost in what is always lost when there is change and the role of catholics and the papacy in and with the confederacy families dr ian clark a leading paleoclimatologist from the university of ottawa says “if we look at climate in the geological time frame we would never suspect co as a major climate driver you can’t say that co will drive climate it certainly never did in the past” bobby my husband and i started laughing jay said what what's so funny the consequences of this catastrophe continue today with thousands of disabled survivors suffering from the chernobyl syndrome of radiationrelated illnesses and the urgent need to replace the

look around even going up to for elaborate ones but if you have bookshelves beds and desks around your walls i hardly think you'll require or maybe not even fit a giant olive tree complete with flock of escaping birdsyou can find wall stickers either online or many retailers who deal in home decor do sell them including the likes of target who at this very moment are selling a florel set of for about i bought some today so once i get them up i'll tell you how it goes as you know darby has dyslexia his eyes aren't quite as fit as the rest of this body which means he has trouble reading he is currently in year and reading at a year level the interesting thing is he loves the reading experience he is quite good with his comprehension fantastic with facts ability to predict character assessment creating stories of his own and the like he just can't read easily he also understands many of the rules of punctuation he can spell out loud he has a huge vocabulary and is very articulate with his words he just can't write easily dyslexia is like that so for a week the kiddos have not seen any show or movie on the list they are watching things like franklin little bear berenstain bears

ready for it it's worth it totally worth it this is the best job in the world and i wouldn't trade it for anything there is currently a steady consistent voice telling me all the faults and character flaws i have given reign to this week and i am in complete agreement with the internal assessment i’ve watched a couple of programs this week that give that voice tangibility one is the biggest loser the focus this season is “no excuses” the other is the most recent episode of tabatha takes over where she’s faced with a business owner whose apathetic uncaring response to feeling overwhelmed is to

he is and trusts him without reservation the spirit never bears witness to an argument about christ but he never fails to witness to a proclamation of christ crucified dead and buried and now ascended

about the space between one culture and another the space that is created from travel the space that opens up in oneself from traveling within and understanding different worlds i think about what it

if i heard this right a light blue hanky stuffed in your left back pocket means you like to receive oral sex while a light blue hanky sticking out of your right back pocket indicates that you give oral sex when it comes to green the left back pocket signifies you're a hustler and the right implies that you're a buyer moving on to yellow the left is all about receiving golden showers and the right means you give them just as he was about to explain what the colour red represents al's character bails which is a shame because i was dying to know what the red hanky stood for i'm gonna go

yourself with people places and things that will remind you of god and your need for him so that you will be propelled back to the word and prayer the apps you use the music you listen to the people you engage with on facebook and twitter and where you choose to eat your lunch ie – to get a good view of god’s creation can all be used to help you cultivate a heart of love and devotion to god that will equip you for the fight against temptation when it occurs fighting temptation begins well before the battle ever begins so pray for god to give you the motivation and discipline to prepare for attack when this happens your reactions to temptation will only be quicker more decisive and more intentional so we were dog owners for less than hours and that’s ok with me it is such a joy to be

something cartographers in business in order to escape the last plague in egypt god’s people were to apply the blood of a sacrificial lamb on their doorposts and lintel so that when the angel saw the blood he would ‘pass over’ their house ex this final plague was god’s decisive stroke against the false gods that held god’s people in bondage and resulted in their deliverance from slavery and release into freedom well let's start this post with friday last show somehow strange it's over and i don't know why i've got drunk after two glasses of whiskey and a half glass not even half i guess of absinthe maybe 'cause i didn't eat anything the whole day maybe because i didn't drink for weeks 'cause i took antibiotics or maybe even because of the antibiotics friday was the last day of my days treatment another thing i'm glad about no pills anymore however three o'clock was way too early and i felt way too drunk but i didn't had a hangover next morning if i remember correctly i never ever had a real hangover and this was the first or second time i felt drunk but i guess i wasn't even drunk 'cause when i was home i felt pretty well hm enough about that i shouldn't blog about drinking experiences d i'm just glad i didn't have to drive home that's another thing why i usually don't drink when i'm out the church directory was printed a year before my husband and i arrived at our new church god scheduled my moment with cheryl through a misprint he knew cheryl’s need a year before she did he knew even in my loneliness that he could use me i assure you that the poor have no

overcook them like i did in focusing of this year's word contentment i have already been trying to focus on him and leaning on him to provide for me a safe place however when i don't immediately see those times i will continue to focus on god trusting him to get me through it i can't expect everything to always be rosy but i can expect him to be there with me until those mists lift because he never makes any mistakes this realization of collaborative work did not transfer over to my academic writing quickly i slowly awakened to the benefit of peer revision and editing for my own work because i was usually the one editing other people’s works in high school i was actually hired as a tutor for various subjects but i never actually asked others for help on my own papers only in college did i really start asking for help with my writing obviously there was always collaboration when the teachers read over our drafts and gave them back full of red ink but this was always formalized and less effective than individually discussing the papers the same things that happened with my creative writing eventually occurred when i stared asking for help freshman year ideas were exchanged gaps filled in and my writing got stronger even when a giant flaw was exposed and by this evening i have something that i'm smitten with leah is accused of a crime she didn't commit dumped by adam the man she planned to marry she escapes to aunt jayne's smallholding in the kent village of winkleigh marsh heartbroken and homeless she strives to clear her name and deal with her emotions marnie heard the toxic phrase but it didn’t stop her she was raised by an energetic foolish mother and a didactic indignant father and she early learned to push through any sneer or awkwardness to get an answer her parents’ mistakes were obvious to her always and she was able to overlook those mistakes mostly while she asked her questions and basked in their boggled pride older cabin groups go on a one or two night trip and learn a bit more about what it takes to live in the wilderness for a short time we are so proud watching these campers go out with their counselors and jcs in canoes or on a backpacking trail although sometimes it rains or the mosquitoes come out to play everyone who comes back from their trip can say “i did that” these kids learn the value of working together to get where they want to go provide their own meals and get along in a small group and they usually have a great time and have some great stories to tell when they get back but austin aries isn’t impressed

have appeared in unison out of pittsburgh pennsylvania cleveland ohio and hartland michigan bad stuff not very unique but then again sequels shouldn’t typically be unique they are by definition “more of the same” strange how i can enjoy a novel in which not much of anything happens at least so far about the most dramatic plot development is that someone's pet iguana died other than that it's mostly a character study in which a pound sociology professor decides to interview a twentysomething homeless sexoffender who is still a virgin they become friends opposites attract and their stories about how they got to be who they are have me hitting the old pagerefresh button it's lost memory of skin by russell banks if you're curious bag kmart proposed budget and detailed cost estimates by professional estimators  my usually softspoken cousin ron commented on facebook last week that it would be great if people would spend less time on discrediting people and organizations including religion and more time praising positive things in life i decided to take this cue from cuz and work to post more positive things people are doing a good place to start is the church my family attends evangel baptist church in boardman oh even with the bad health that has challenged me i do have a lot of good health too for that i am grateful he intended to walk to his aunt’s home and kill her also but after hearing his grandmother’s last words decided to call the affidavit said happy new year everyone such a cliche yet sounds good to me ever the cockeyed optimist i've scanned the headlines this morning the world is in a mess killing over religion tribal warfare continues unabated and yet i still have a deep seated notion that this year may bring some respite from the economic trials of the last several years oh how i would love to steal that handle for my own house change who i forever am in you happy thursday blog friends catherine lutz argues militarization is connected to “militant

of the labels given for this suffering is ‘duty’ i am thinking if you dislike reading you are not going to own an ereader or ereader apps on your tablet i mean if you don’t like reading why would you get a kindle app on your tablet newspapers and magazines are one thing whole books are something else the latitude of retribution falls is a hard book to classify it has classic elements of fantasy but with scifi tech akin to steampunk yet i hesitate to put it in that camp as it is much more advanced retribution falls is much more than a firefly riff as it is like an entire season without one lull compressed into less than pages of complete and utter bliss i do wonder if it would exist without the influence of joss whedon but either way wooding does an incredible job of creating a group of

translation reminds us that the guiding principle of the new translation is a closer adherence to the latinnot a sharper critique of our virtue but this makes absolutely no sense who cares what the guiding principle was the end result is that the latin is more condemnatory for no discernible reason and there is no scriptural grounding for this “sharper critique” either the first appearance of

recognise at once without the shadow of a doubt however when i read that quote to john just now he snorted and i must say that in view of freddie's earlier comments about certainty that without the shadow of a doubt possibly has an ironic ring last week he was so worked up about some things that were not actually real he laid down in his bed and kept going over and over them with me i told him he just needed to relax that he didn't need to worry so much he is being so well cared for he gave me the silent soul searching steel blue stare softly grabbed my hand and said i'll always remember you inks stampin' up pens basic black basic grey old olive rose red update i enjoyed this it was a simple story but the performances as usual lifted it up my god bill was a baby in this movie i mean by his looks and i hear there was tons of criticism about his performance but i didn’t see anything wrong with it again it was jarring more because he didn’t look like he usually does and yes maybe he overacted a bit but there were times that really fit the character of joe joe was pretty torn about his desires i think this was my first time seeing barbara stanwyck and i liked her but the romance aspect wasn’t my favorite part and cobb was completely unrecognizable and his performance was great as well i also keep thinking he’s someone else oops i thought the final boxing match was shot beautifully and the ending was moving the officer went to his car with john’s license and sat on the radio for several minutes as john walked to the mustang he took only a few steps before the

had to find him when i stepped out of the shower he wasn’t in the room and continued not to be there as i changed put on sunblock put on makeup and wandered around the room a few times waiting eventually i went downstairs and found him in the librarycafe area reading the newspaper and espn online the freelance graphic designer was stressed since he recently quit his plan of working freelance and supplementing his income as a driver hasn’t turned out as he thought he seemed to be at a crossroads it reminded me of where i was i feel already that i am an important member of the

the tangerine and the kumquat – from china and go back years arab traders brought them to europe at the end of the roman empire along with spices silk and sugar and the main crop was established around the area of seville in andalucia hence the name we english know them by the skin of the bitter orange citrus aurantium is distinct from its sweet cousin c sinensis in that it is baggy and heavily dimpled reminiscent of cellulite here in southern california bitter oranges are often left to rot on the branch untouched and overlooked but up until the nineteenth century it was the

its finished and that a slight companionable ghost for some reason coffee makes me feel more philosophical and deep anyone elseor maybe i'm just strange that way i grew up in a town wo a starbucks and

yes it is parttime and does not provide all the income i need – not all i want mind you just what i need to survive but i have a job i think onethird of us in the room have jobs but those jobs aren't providing what we need to adequately feed ourselves and our families i also have a home it is falling apart faster than i can repair it and i can’t heat it adequately but i’m not living in shelters or worse and like a few people in the room trying to survive out on the streets how could i sit there waiting for my number to be called to fill a shopping cart when so many others sitting around me have it so much worse i felt like a whinyass fraud but i stayed i needed the food the church was giving out more than i needed my dignity at that point save your good lovin' for me god of miracles we pray that miracles and testimonies shall become come in our lives in this month as we commonly breath in air on daily basis freely without knowing the value but we say thank you lord for making the air available to us and granting us the privilege to have them so freely and we decree that in every seconds minutes hours mornings afternoons evenings nights days and weeks in this month we shall live in miracles we shall dwell in testimonies all way through and we shall testify in the midst of the saints and to the glory of god the father god the son and god the holy spirit this we pray receive and claim over our lives in jesus name amen times times and times look awards don't have to make sense they often don't there are controversial choices every year inconsistent choices bizarre choices but

the year over rodgers isn't he also the mvp over rodgers they play the same position they both led their teams into the playoffs this seems cartoonish i hope that all of y'all know jesus and that i'll be seeing y'all in heaven one day i consider each of y'all a friend even if we will never meet in real life we have all been placed in each other's lives for a reason we share real emotions and

or crime family novels is the focus on friends and family anya has a fantastic support system she is if not in name then in fact the head of her family and she does a stellar job of taking care of them and keeping them together she shoulders much more of a burden than should be hers but she did it in a realistic way sometimes in stories like these the character is too adult or too childlike but

other was determined by your reaction macho policing just start small and keep your expectations realistic – each goal met boosts your confidence and sharpens your focus in both life and marriage soon you’ll begin to set your sights higher and nothing will ever seem impossible in the beginning of the film a man climbs out of the back of a car and breaks the fourth wall to talk to the viewer about the ‘great’ movie tradition of “no reason” he calls it this means the nonsensical things we overlook due to suspension of disbelief in many classic films – why characters don’t go to the bathroom for example apparently that is his excuse for the rest of this film which features again a psychic killer tire lusting after a woman at a cheap motel isn’t there a bit of a divide in magnitude there overlooking not seeing a character go to the bathroom is a world away from overlooking a tire that comes to life for absolutely no reason and kills people with psychic powers those are very very different things and the fallacy of the movie’s argument goes right over its own head resulting in a rather humorous effect but not for the reasons the director intended it’s more funny in spite of itself for automobiles approximately of the vehicles on the road will stop at least temporarily thereby possibly triggering accidents as well as congestion at field levels above kvm for vehicles that

having success with the first two seasons sheehan moved on to other projects if you follow the series closely you are immediately turned off by the new addition of “rudy” rudy is basically nathan played by a different actor but also has taken the raunchy humor even higher than nathan after the first two episodes i was going to stop watching the series but then i realized that the writers overcame the loss of sheehan the humor is still hilarious and the characters still maintain some integrity without completely falling apart i actually enjoyed the character of rudy played by actor joseph gilgun being featured on angie's pretty blog a little inspiration and for being reminded of what inspires me my children my faith my small corner of the world and the good people who occupy it thank you angie but as with anything that is manmade it is open to flaws and hence not only is it allowed to be questioned questioning it should be mandatory so the flaws can be fixed clinique great

called maddie's on jones my chocovanilla icebox cake it is of great comfort that in the midst of turmoil and change the seasons provide a gentle backdrop of continuity and familiarity do we understand what christ did for us philippians nasb “being found in appearance as a man he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death even death on a cross” when that verse speaks of jesus humbling himself it means that he did not have to leave his position of glory that he held in heaven with the father but he came down as a simple man a carpenter and walked this earth in poverty and strife he allowed others to abuse him and mock him he was sentenced to die without even a real charge against him that was true yet he did not fight back he could have in the account of his arrest in matthew he stated that if he wanted he could summon up more than twelve legions of angels to fight for him but he sacrificed his own glory his reputation and was “obedient” to the point of death fresh chicken thighs boneless skinless lb kg eating right first things first publication date april since seeing brian’s post about asking students this question i’ve been thinking about how my students might answer in one section of honors physics we’re just wrapping up a second look at momentum and energy transfer mainly using problems that involve a transition between using both in the same analysis my honors kids have written answers on scraps of paper to questions from my “internet friends” before so they were ready for another round they also enjoy signing their responses with their classmates names and the reading of the answers that i do when they’ve all been collected—the voices in the class are pretty unique so they usually know who has written which response anyway first let’s look at it from a logical approach we know these facts today i’m sharing an article by denise le fay she does a nice job describing the ascension symptoms and reactions to solar flares that so many of my clients and colleagues continue to experience someday i'll be as bored with my problems as my potential if i’m a superrecognizer then i don’t know if this idea of superrecognizers having more holistic perception with less focus on individual elements explains the difference between us and people with normal levels of ability i do very much notice individual elements of faces consciously and unconsciously as well as recognizing whole faces in a way that feels automatic and uncontrolled i will notice if different people have mouths or ears that look similar and also distinctive i recall that a boy i knew when i was a teen and he was a child had a william shatner mouth which is a quite an unusual type of mouth where the upper lip looks the larger barack obama and nelson mandela seem to have very similar smiles and lower faces but not identical faces i think the difference between a superrecognizer and a regular recognizer might be that the former does both holisitc and detailed perception well and also in a wellintegrated manner i believe enhanced brain wiring akin to synaesthesia might be the basis of this enhanced integration of both modes of perception i suspect that an emphasis on perceiving faces featurebyfeature might be more characteristic of poor face recognition than good face recognition in the recent cbs minutes story about prosopagnosia and superrecognizers the prosopagnosic artist chuck close was asked to identify the faces of some famous people he did manage to identify some of the faces and he explained how he did it he identified jay leno from his very unusual chin and picked tiger woods from his lips another tradition is to remove a berry every time you kiss someone under the mistletoe when there are no more berries there are no more kisses for you buster i'm sure there's also some lore connected with the kiss corresponding to the final berry will be the kiss you share with your future wife let it bloom he had every possible option open to him because of who he was he would not have been questioned for opening an investigation after what he had heard paterno was in a position where he could have

mile marker and saw jason and my parents i burst into tears after discovering no one at any of my doors and turning on porch lights and flood lightsi did become a bit concerned i figured it was a prank but there is always a little doubt in your mind that maybe something more sinister is at work i called my grandson i asked him if he had been here by any chancejust clowning around he said no why i told him he became concerned within minutes he and his friends were here checking out my yard and then they retreated to an area where they could watch and sat there for about a half hour just

parents family taking time out from the usual routine of lectures and seminars and alongside it the city lifestyle at first its great most of us are probably greeted with the welcome wagon and are genuinely excited to see our loved ones once again for the time that we are home we probably don’t have to do much if any cooking or even food shopping for that matter meaning more money to spend on clothes and things we love nor is it likely that we will have to do laundry or any heavy housework however whether you’re enjoying the lieins having days out with the fam or utilising this time to get lots of productive things done like me for example it is highly inevitable that at some point most of us will begin to feel at a loose end we will effectively be somewhat ‘stuck in a rut’ music is a

will the voting public have if they only read about me waiting passively in this lavish hotel while elizabeth endures unspeakable horrors and deprivations at the hands of her abductor” he knew he had to balance cooperation with authorities with his private plans and the last thing he wanted was the pinkertons involved but he also knew that was out of his hands if edward had already contacted them they’d only muddy up the glory he wanted for himself and complicate his plan to kill valderas outright lol i might sound like a freak but this is how it is and i’m not trying to hide it anymore it was

to the food but the herald sun also loves dogs as can be seen on about page five or so even third day give or take there was the article about the labrador fetching beer from the fridge for its owner

tabloid writer will be able to tell you are even better and cuter than fat kids because they allow you to use lines like 'canine obesity crisis sweeping this nation' and 'cries for help from

or months the aim of this “wittem project” and the resulting code published in april httpwwwcopyrightcodeeu is to promote transparency and consistency in european copyright law the members of the wittem group share a concern that the process of copyright law making at the european level lacks transparency and that the voice of academia all too often remains unheard the group believes that a european copyright code drafted by legal scholars might serve as a model or reference tool for future harmonization or unification of copyright at the european level the members of the wittem group hope that this european copyright code will contribute to the establishment of a body of transparent and consistent copyright law that protects the moral and economic interests of creators while

psychiatric hospital approaches an individual’s eating disorder from a biological psychosocial and psychological focus understanding the complexity of the illness theaurorapsychiatric hospital’s program helps individuals develop the skills to take better care of themselves from a nutritional emotional and social perspective one of the initial steps is to address the physical needs of a patient “when someone enters the program they are experiencing a lot of anxiety regarding food” explains anne sprenger rd registered dietician withaurorapsychiatric hospital “a dietician meets with them at the very beginning of their treatment to initiate the process of refeeding them we set nutritional goals and help them develop personalized steps to work toward those goals” the program is customized to each individual food allergies and religious and cultural preferences are taken into consideration initially the meals are planned for them but as individuals progress they become actively involved in understanding how to select healthy choices “education is a vital component of our nutritional services” continues anne “we need to get our patients the correct information regarding nutrition explain how they can take care of themselves from a nutritional perspective and give them the support they need to get back on track with eating healthy balanced meals” as clinically indicated patients can participate anywhere in the full continuum of inpatient partial hospitalization or intensive outpatient programs an individual’s needs are taken into consideration when trying to find the most costeffective approach to deal with an oftentimes lengthy process all options include psychiatric treatment group and individual therapy with a general emphasis on cognitive behavioral therapy and dialectical behavioral therapy education groups family involvement relapse prevention in addition to the nutrition program “despite the outward physical appearance of some eating disorder sufferers the toll taken on the inside is far more devastating” explains sandra blaies lcsw supervisor of eating disorder services ataurorapsychiatric hospital “the eating disorders program offers a wide variety of complementary therapies ranging from art therapy mindful yoga and food challenge experiences to help patients learn how to identify and express their feelings or emotions” in addition family involvement is an integral part of a patient’s care family education and support groups for the family and friends of patients provides both the education they need to support their loved one as well as gives them a channel through which they can address their own fears and frustrations “in our program families and friends are considered a valuable resource in the recovery program” addssandy indications that someone may have an eating disorder range from binge eating or food restriction to selfinduced vomiting abusing laxatives or diet pills a

favourite film and tv adaptations wonderstruck is the story or stories of two children set fifty years aparta girl in and a boy in the girl’s story is told entirely in drawings and the boy’s in text having read the first part of the book there appears to be an interesting relationship between the two stories the drawings once again fill the page and have a cinematic quality using closeup panorama tracking and point of view there is an attractive quality to the drawings a strong outline and bold tonal technique used most effectively creating rounded and textured forms and a strong linear quality so let us review the possibilities and consider how they might be approached a man's cupping his hand to scoop water from a highland burn as the sun rises view from the south my strategy was

willing to meet with any one regarding the ese program policy etc these children do not have a voice but i do and i will make sure it is heard i have gotten a lot of attention in the past week from local media as well as educational magazines blogs publications etc and will keep talking with them until the gap between the ese and ‘normal student population’ is gone food i did a little more

to see a film theatrically here in new york virtually every day the way i was doing throughout say this past summer have i started to burn out on moviegoing in general i don't think so butlet me put it this way i ended up seeing only one film theatrically or otherwise all weekend and for once i was totally okay with that meanwhile some girlfriends of mine and i are going to see tom green tonight

stirred up to become the mau mau and the anc driven to fire necklacing fury our schools our politicians and our media are at work encouraging within the new arrivals and their british born offspring a

affected many because it hit home just how vulnerable we are to the whims and fancy of any state body that wishes to abuse its power the ease with which cheryl miller was locked up the ease with which her family were denied their right to their own kin the ease with which the authorities justified their actions and the ease with which they are now twisting the story away from their abuse of rights and inability to follow protocol and instead making it about whether cheryl miller is mentally ill or not is not just disgusting it is downright scary charming man iv – the jagermeister shot with no

negative thoughts 'ugg its another work day' 'i wonder what fires i will have to put out today' 'i can't wait until today is over' 'why did he break up with me' i'll give you one guess how my days

first learned this recipe when my boyfriend received a bunch of beets from his csa while he was excited i cringed beets are those weird imbetween plants that are too sweet to be what i conceive as a veggie too squishy in texture to be a veggie but not sweet enough to be a fruit basically i don’t like them that didn’t stop us from having a lot of them so i had to figure out a plan i set to my rule of thumb for produce–if you don’t like it in its own form turn it into a baked good for me that’s muffins as usual i’m gonna make a short analysis trying to figure out how they got nominated liza minnelli was probably the only lock for a nomination that year she carries her film cabaret was a huge success both with the critics and the academy and she had already won a golden globe for her performance adding to it all she was already an oscar darling being nominated years before plus she was the daughter of their beloved judy garland past nominee from here on i’m sure the voting was all over the place it has been the coldest wettest and windiest spring that i can remember i on the other hand was lost in thought about promises well you know you belong here if … you play musical

scorekeeping which i endorse requires a form of strong permission what it is to be entitled to a theoretical or practical commitment must be independent of what it is to be committed to it in order for his account of the various inferential relations permissive committive and incompatibility that constitute conceptual content to get off the ground this means that i can’t hold that obligation and permission are straightforwardly interdefinable and thereby makes it harder for me to uphold the unity of the deontic proposed above i don’t have a complete solution to this problem but i have a rough strategy although i don’t think that all forms of permission can be simply reduced to a corresponding notion of obligation i do think that what distinguishes such strong forms of permission can be explained in terms of the ways in which they function as reasons for action if i can then explain the general structure of this kind of reasoning in terms of the fundamental obligations that underlie it i will have indirectly explained permission in terms of obligation this strategy would not only shore up the unity just mentioned but would also secure the primacy of the notion of obligation discussed above however this isn’t so well worked out so i won’t discuss it further stars that were dancing across the beam of light gleefully shining disrupting the flatly placid still and peaceful

masterpiece a lot of the songs that i used not to like … i’m a big fan of now since we play them on stage … like ‘back in new york city’ i used to not be a fan of because i used to think ‘i can’t sing that he’s screaming’ for a singer it’s not something you look forward to” he said and laughed “but then when we played the song together it’s such a strong riff and the whole feeling is really really awesome it changed my whole perspective of the song it’s one of the songs i love to play and that i love to listen to which was not the case when i was younger” as i sat looking out over the water i

through our own fears in life and not let our personal fears dictate our actions and only act out of love and acceptance our life will change our world will change and as my life changes i by my actions by my example will allow more change for those around me my decisions will be based in love and when it comes to the choices we see people make it the world with our new awake self we will see

stress in an office with people he knows and likes but now we must decide whether or not giving up insurance is worth the risk to have more money in our pockets without taking the insurance and a better work environment we may be able to qualify for some prescription programs through pharmaceutical companies and with samples from our doctors we may make it through in regards to medication the doctors appointment would be expensive but may be less out of pocket than paying for insurance on top of a deductible and copay “yes” maggie moosfree ice cream cone and this is a massive ice cream

newest member of my household is my faux cowhide rug but first i have to start with the coffee table see i've wanted a gold glass coffee table for a while because the wood one was just too heavy and visually bulky i searched all over the place at all sorts of price points for a version that also had a shelf underneath and couldn't find one anywhere i had seen bossy color paint one from ikea gold and it was quite pretty in her living room but it was the same size as my wood one and i wanted smaller plus i was iffy about the floral pattern on the shelf would that be goofy in real life more searching and the best i could come up with was a k version that was mirrored not glass so i caved bought the ikea one and painted it gold and i love it i don't notice how big it is anymore and i use the shelf constantly so i don't have papers piled up on top which means i can actually put decorative objects up there like my glass platter or some flowers or both i don't want to be a spoiler here

bajaj institute of management in mumbai india and a phd in marketing from columbia university who believes that traditional marketing is going away he argues that companies that perform well in today’s business landscape may not even spend any money on marketing at all perhaps some reviewers are not so concerned with an authors' feelings but worry rather that a bad review will stop a book selling this concern is founded on the assumption that anyone reading a bad review will be put off even looking at a book but it's a breathtaking patronization of readers to assume that they'll swallow wholesale a blogger's views as some commenters have said they are often prompted by a bad review to read a book and are not only pleasantly surprised but provoked to write a contradictory positive review susan hill however has stated that she has noted 'lemming' behaviour among bloggers i hope she's not right someone somewhere during this week's discussion can't find it at the moment

times i have read this part of the gospel and just glossed over the fact that jesus is modeling for us how to act in the will of the father we know that jesus is god so the fact that he could or couldn’t do anything on his own is debatable however if we are truly trying to do the will of the father because he is the one who sent us why do we always try to do things on our own i guess i should just be speaking for myself but phrases like “god helps those who help themselves” and other such rubbish come to mind the truth is god will only be able to help me grow spiritually closer to him if i stop helping myself to whatever pleasure or fleshly desire i want christians today need to stand strong against the redefining of worship to mean whatever man thinks it should mean god speaks about the worship he demands it is wise for us to read what he has given us this cute pin was designed by annette e martin and i had found it over on our demonstrator board i fell in love with it so i found

school started up at the end of august i've had less time to blog this school year a combination of factors has me focused more on my classroom with students up from last year there's more preparation and planning more responsibility and a lot more papers and notebooks to read i was successful in my baking and cooking endeavors last friday for the most part – slacked as usual with the last of the clean up thankful for the prep work i did the day before because good gawd cooking from scratch and eating less processed food can and does mean a lot more work for someone me you really need to be dedicated and buy into the philosophy of whole foods clean eating etc if you don’t you won’t be able to sustain the practice total lots since none of us know when we will die we are to steward our time until death meets us jesus knew when he would die he knew the end of his earthly life was soon and he redeemed the time and his last words in john we are given a front row seat to reading the last words that jesus spoke to his disciples the last word jesus’ teaching in the upper room by wallace benn explores these last words of jesus in the upper room but it does raise the question of

thankyouformychristmaspresent note i had meant to leave inside all this hope i breathe is given by the hand that carries me the key to the culture was to stop measuring presence – ie punching the clock as at a factory – and to start measuring results and outcomes this of course is true for any consultant i am not hired to be busy i am hired to get some specific things done in reality that is how all work should be measured but in reality that is not how work is measured we measure instead the appearance of work as evidenced by how much we are seen at the office for those unfamiliar with the scene author chetan bhagat had made an issue of the credit the moviemaker vidhu vinod chopra gave to chetan’s book for having adopted its storyline for the movie the creditline should have been bigger bolder and more prominent said chetan bhagat the filmmaker on his part held chetan got more than his due director raju hirani had apparently reworked the story so much that what viewers saw in

the addition of another gw approx last year it has recently been forced to restart some of its nuclear reactors after having imported power in december from neighbouring austria to stabilise its network but mode is also quite a slippery concept in that it relates to the ways in which we understand other ideas about how texts are produced and received so we use the notion of the mode continuum to talk about different dimensions along which we can place texts the clickable graphic of this can offer you a few pointers as to which dimensions are most relevant at this level you might have used different terms for some of these eg asynchronous for delayed or synchronous for immediate but it's all the same really shameless is very funny this is one of the show's best insights and perhaps the best example of what it gets right about living in poverty being poor is fucking hilarious if you don't believe me just try being poor everything takes on the aspect of gallows humor and it's easy to laugh at your misfortune because the alternative scarcely bears considering when you're desperate everything assumes comic dimensions every character becomes exaggerated grossly distorted and every decision is a hobsons' choice usually when tv does poor they get it all wrong and that's fine because the reality of being desperate to pay your rent and having to choose between food and gas is too depressing to really want to see reflected back but shameless gets it right in some very important almost uncanny ways i can't say i grew up as poor as the gallagher family but i have been that poor at various points and i certainly grew up closer to the gallagher's than the huxtables but then most people reading this probably did and that's another thing that the show gets right being poor does make you feel ashamed it makes you feel terrible about yourself it eats away at your selfconfidence and your mental reserves without ever offering up anything resembling consolation eventually being poor for long enough forces you to make some very hard decisions decisions that either end with you completely broken and discarded or that leave you a monster or a sociopath really it just reminds me that there is a balance i do have to do for me i do have to do for others there is a happy medium where both can be accomplished easy hourly mantra “god grant me the serenity to accept the things i

hate the film but the reasons that prevented me from not caring a whole lot about it are recurring problems in many films particularly in the last decade as much as i have read many critics accuse scorsese's the departed of being a sellout project where he provided a more commerciallyacceptable version of his previous gangster sagas i have to say that scorsese's chasing of trends particularly in the aviator and now shutter island bothers me more the aviator contains some of his most impersonal filmmaking a trendy bythenumbers biopic with a cgiaided glossy aesthetic housed in a selfimportant shell as oscar bait that i could not honestly differentiate from the works of ron howard it seemed like scorsese wanted to convey the beauty of flying because he felt the audiences would lap up the ride even if his direction demonstrated that he had no understanding of what that experience truly feels like this was a grounded filmmaker trying to convince us that he had wings “this may sound strange but could you maybe mime a cello” as the morphine flowed into his bloodstream the overwhelming supremacy of the pain radiating from the hard grasping knot in his gut receded it wasn’t that it had disappeared at this stage of the cancer’s progress where nearly all his body’s natural defences had been overwhelmed that was too much to hope for the general staff of doctors their radiological battles lost and chemotherapeutic campaigns routed had abandoned the fight leaving the opiates to fight the last hopeless battles before his body finally raised the white flag of systemic surrender but the pain retreated becoming just one component of the reality which could be left behind in the distance as the morphine carried him away into dreams and memories … please leave if you

to have one prominent flavor in a cookie that needs to have several flavors working in synergy it is a good idea to combine two different natural sweeteners rather than just using one or another because i added cocoa to this simple drop cookie neither honey nor maple syrup the two sweeteners upon which i most rely is a flavor i really wanted to be prominent to overshadow the chocolate by combining the two sweeteners in about a ratio neither the maple nor the honey flavors stand out in this cookie but the sweetness all there turning the cocoa into a chocolaty bunch of goodness that does a fantastic job of enveloping the tart pop from cranberries still it’s not necessary to go to this extreme to get caught up in contemplation of what you don’t want to imitate there are doubtless plenty of reasons why so many people in the climate change movement never got around to accepting the sharp reductions in their personal carbon footprints that they wanted to impose on everyone else but i’ve long suspected that too much contemplation of what they thought they were fighting was one of them there were some people in that movement who tried to sketch out visions of a lowcarbon future that was more interesting and more appealing than the present but by and large the movement presented the world with a choice between a continuation of business as usual by lowcarbon means on the one hand and planetary dieoff on the other the ineffective but familiar strategy of trying to get people to change by scaring the bejesus out of them—sinners in the hands of an angry gaia—took over from there preaching vehemently about greedy polluters ravaging the earth in an orgy of conspicuous consumption the result was to make this image so powerful that a great many people in the

anyway wrong i reject the idea that journalistic or documentary photography photos looking to reveal something essential about a subject is irrelevant or is necessarily a dramatic part of an arching political agenda sometimes as with the abu ghraib incident or with roger clemens’ steroid case photographs can be of vast importance politically and socially but most of the time photographers settle for doing their best just make people slow down to actually notice and think about what they are looking at welling is great at doing this great in delaying our ultimate judgment about what a photograph is or is of facilitating the selfconscious mechanism of looking if this makes people better which should an artist’s idealistic hope we receive an added bonus after the many months since

and trigger travelling across britain by train being offered sweets by kindly strangers because instead of going to sleep at a reasonable hour i know with work it is sometimes difficult but that doesn't excuse the other nights out of you are doing what you should have been doing in the day the fact of the matter is that the uaf lie to gain support because their numbers are diminishing rapidly the mdl lie because that’s what their quran tells them to do in nonislamic lands which islam calls ‘land of war’ members of their community are allowed to lie cheat and steal to benefit themselves but

the deeper the hugs and tissueswiped tears and runny noses i also hit the jackpot with my own mom i once heard that the most important thing a parent can do is to listen just listen to their children without offering advice or making judgements that is my mom i remember when she would come home from work and i would just yak away about what i learned that day what happened and how i felt about it she listened to it all i’m pretty sure there were times when she wished i would just be quiet as a kid i didn’t feel like i fit in with the rest of the crowd and always felt odd so her just listening to me made me feel that there was somewhere i belonged i remember we would hang out with another family and that mom would just yell at her children all of the time everything warranted a yell from her and every time we left i thanked my mom for not being her i've created a cute little circle card today using my favourite bunny clementine from stampfairy i've also tried using my pencils again

for me and my baby as far as our birth plan i would absolutely recommend hypnobirthing to anyone and for first time moms i wouldn’t read anything before you’ve read the hypnobirthing book much of the

“scary experience” our society often makes it out to be no matter what kind of birth you want you and your baby can benefit from this method those who casually say “oh we’re going to try to do it naturally but we’ll see how it goes” are usually not mentally prepared for the challenge for women who would really like to have a natural birth you have to go into it with a completely dedicated mindset and an understanding of what is going on as well as a supportive birth team that knows your wishes i can’t say enough how important it was that we had dawn the doula for support and our

always wanted a farm but i thought i'd have a vegetarian farm i was young and naive then we decided to stop being vegetarian but eat only meat humanely raised shortly after that our good friends taught us how to butcher ducks and then a pig we learned so much from them i'm talking about brett who wrote for the winter newsletter so really this is still all so new to us it doesn't come naturally yet at all and we have no idea how to properly cut meat into fancy things like steaks and i feel like i'm reading another language when i read meat cooking recipes never having cooked it in my adult life but we're making great strides and learning more more all the time just another project i am working on for my office at work so far i have shown you the large frame with coffee filter

a weird day for whatever reason – i’m solo’ing this whole thing and it’s really different to do it on your own not like i don’t have a ton of help between my parents and jon’s parents – but it’s still different though it’s been five weeks now so it’s starting to become the norm a new silence out of all pins most of them show beautiful white cabinets and marble counters i have a deep obsession with white cabinets and marble counter tops although i'm not always faithful to the marble sometimes i think about wood counters or even stainless steal but out of everything the white stays large numbers are another matter they tend to recreate examples of what they have left behind there is less pressure for all to learn the language and adapt to mainstream british culture and to “thewaywedothings” as numbers grow there is competition for housing benefits and education the white indigenous population starts to feel threatened in britain this racial transition has been very rapid it was only twenty years after windrush when enoch powell issued his famous warning over forty years on the situation is immeasurably worse what marks the precise threshold when we cross from low level and tolerable immigration – defined as being tolerable to the white host society – and move towards to mass nonwhite immigration is not easy to define even for professional demographers but one thing can be stated with complete certainty there is huge unease among the white indigenous population in britain about the country’s racial make up and what this bodes for the future but then something very strange indeed happened i think we're very lucky to have so much available inspiration on tap via the internet and other media the world has become such a small place some people would argue that its made it more difficult to be original but if you look at all the imagery and videos that is made available to us via technology then i think there's more sources of inspiration out there than ever before a big part of my classroom “it was all the more difficult for me because i had two children from a previous relationship” coaxed into unfurling reaching stretching breathless is an unrelenting movie from the start – the main male character sanghun dishing out two aggressive beatings – it doesn’t hold back on the punching and kicking filmed in a docudrama style there’s no glorification of the violence – this is all nasty stuff violence is never far in every frame the structure of the movie may seems repetitive moving in circles as if to mirror the circle of violence that the characters are trapped in the bullied child becomes the bully in adulthood the victimised mother produces a traumatised daughter a beating follows another beating and so on director yang ikjoon also the writer producer and lead actor has crafted a movie that explores themes of domestic violence and its effects on people after an uncompromising first hour letting the viewer astonished and weary of yangik jook’s shock and awe approach the director suddenly introduces a sentimental edge to the movie with an unexpected touching montage of the two main characters the thug and the high school girl taking the gangster’s nephew to the fair where he can at last be a child again the movie seems a bit loose and unfocused in the middle but it is a powerful movie for those who manage to reach the end the ending works superbly in a series of flashbacks leaving room for hope the transformation of sanghun is quick but remains believable a martyr of child abuse his will to change his ways and break the cycle will eventually kill him but save his family it is a powerful conclusion to an overly brutal movie that leaves bruises like a punch in the face but also handles its gentle moments with a disarming sincerity although you can't really tell by the picture the sequins are silver and gold so i think either silver or gold jewelry would work gledwood no offense to the rock band i didn't name

morning the sermon was on marriage we have had a week let me tell you my sweet juliana has been sick since tuesday with a high fever and what that doctor first thought to be a bladder infection when i say high fever i mean high and i could not get it below thursday night she was so sick i had thought about just going to the er we made it through the night and to the doctor on friday she was in so much pain she would not let me touch her as soon as the doctor saw her he told me she needed to be admitted the bladder infection turned to out to be a kidney infection it is so hard when your husband is away you have two kids in school are planning to have a garage sale the next morning your daughter is having friends over to spend the night and then you are told you need to take your daughter to

feather early that morning i just walked past it though it was quite unusual for me to have done so most times i will pick up a feather that finds it's way into my path oh it's just a silly duck feather let it go you don't have to pick up every feather you see and i moved on what i had tossed aside was the fact that a large quantity of my spiritual messages come through nature and most assuredly through winged ones when i parked that boat successfully on my way back down the feather was still there patiently awaiting my return i snatched it up and marveled at it's beautiful color and proudly accepted my very first duck feather a reward for myself from having kept on keeping on and being aware of the creator's love and confidence in me as the creator has in all creatures and beings which that lovely and omnipotent energy has created even though everything went according to plan even though everything seemed to fall into the right place at the right time nature took over and left me a small reminder that no matter what i want or think i need to do i have little or no control over what happens in the end just after christmas i ended up with a serious cold which evolved into a light lung infection i spent most of the period around new year with a fever coughing up all kinds of foul stuff and feeling thoroughly miserable at which point i realised that whatever my plans had been there was absolutely no point in trying to run kilometres unless i really wanted to harm myself available yearround refrigerate the hearts for about hours or place in your freezer for

of side note for current and prospective clients there is far more to photography – good photography – than meets the eye please don’t believe that every low priced photographer out there is worth it and don’t buy into the misconception that all you need is a nice camera or that it costs nothing to be a photographer and all we do is snap a few photos or that boutiquepersonal photographers are overpriced…i can assure you for the most part they are not i am relieved to say that i was not one of the ones cut but many of the people i have come to know and love in the company were for months i have been trying to find an apartment in paris to rent next week during our school vacation i am so fed up i'm tired of sending emails it's alright to slow down in fact it feels amazing member states and their survivors frank are you in there it was his sister penelope but the desert drowns all in seaghost grain a brightlycoloured box full of stars by dorian dawes later varendi et al showed that within the first hour after birth significantly more babies spontaneously selected a breast treated with amniotic fluid than the alternative untreated breast this attraction appears to be based on olfactory cues thus amniotic fluid augments or overrides the attractiveness of the natural scent of the mother' breast they postulated that observed attraction to amniotic fluid odour may reflect foetal exposure to that substance ie prenatal olfactory learning they also suggested that throughout the evolution of our species it was probably common for women to handle their babies themselves during and following delivery immediately after parturition the mother's hands soiled with birth fluids would transfer the amniotic fluid to her breasts when she first attempted to nurse her neonate this may be observed currently amongst nonhuman primates the data presented illustrates the importance of maternal odours for newborn infants aside from guiding a neonate's overt behavioural responses such olfactory stimuli also appear to have a calming effect on the infant and provide a basis for early individual recognition of yet in all honesty i feel this album is a stepping stone for the scotts while it still holds the ideas and music mosher stands for it does not rival its successor in every department partly because the drums are programmed and sound like it partly because in some tracks the guitars and keyboards are fighting each other instead of adding value this is a equalizing thing i think we just finished the nd day of a day workshop and i have a mess of applique to do tonight for our final day i hate not having a finished project at the end of a workshop so you know i will be up late tonight doing all i can take care all and happy crafting get off your butts and fight for your country americans fight for the vision of america handed down to us by our founders that made this country the greatest in the history of the world if you keep sitting on your butts thinking that others will do all the fighting for you you will wake up one day and wonder what the hell happened i take a moment and reflect when occupy wall street set up camp in the middle of september americans were reminded of the collective power of citizens american history is rich with movements of the people that created change the boston tea party the montgomery bus boycott and the occupy camps across the country all involved citizens coming together with a common desire to participate in shaping the future of this country the tea party sparked the american revolution the bus boycott lead to the fight for civil rights and the occupy movement has focused the national discourse on economic and social inequalities throughout history change in our democracy has been achieved through community organizing and direct action you're done after reading my response my friend revealed his theory which i hope he will write about himself a guest post would be nice or i'll do a link it was that he might choose better among unknown partners and thereby improve his evening by paying a bit more attention to what women were wearing we choose what we wear on purpose so maybe we say something about why were are there and what sort of dance we want to have so do at least some of the men of course as a commenter said on different dresses he knows that he finds me easy to dance with and so he thought he might look with an artist's eye for other women sending the same messages there were apostles before paul the valid apostleship we glean from here and in corinthians is one that comes by a direct call from god and revelation from or of jesus the episode was great and it ended as i expected it to i feel a warm peace with the conclusion i thought it was beautiful and fitting i knew it wouldn't please everyone how could it seriously come on people one new trend that i've been encountering among followers while dancing in close embrace is what i can only describe as a choke hold embrace their left arm is positioned such that the armpit is positioned against my right lateral deltoid or even worse my bicep an immense amount of pressure is then applied to presumably achieve a strong connection all i can say is 'ouch' it feels extremely constrictive especially when i'm trying to turn or even walk on the outside of the follower not to mention the pain i feel afterwards from straining against that embrace apparently there is a female technique meme going viral among teachers now somehow the followers have to use their lats back muscles to achieve a good connection i was informed of this by a follower who has a beautifully comfortable embrace who has figured out how to get a good connection without squeezing the living breath out of leaders on occasion i have also used chocolate buds instead of berries with great results and when banana's were expensive i pureed tinned pears and used that instead of the banana's again super yummy i haven't tried it but you could probably throw in some sultanas instead of berries as well step prepare everything first chop all your veggies season your meat cook your noodles and set everything out that you will need i used steak seasoning salt pepper and cayenne pepper to season my meat i have finished up my kids school shopping and have all their school supplies organzied and ready for the first day of schoolnow time to start working on the halloween hair bows and tutus with that insight let me ask a few questions… “what are you currently doing in your life that you know you can’t afford to do…and haven’t had the strength to change what are you spending money on that you know you don’t need and can’t afford but you just aren’t strong enough to let go of the gift card can just slide down inside or you can make a small holder for it like i did with some card stock and a slit punch i think it turned out kinda cute this wonderful piece of music is made by derek duke and i wrote him a message on facebook to thank him for the beautiful music and i got this answer i originally rolled frank on a random server just to use as a transmog model but really he’s far too awesome to languish away at level unloved and forgotten so i deleted my level female undead warlock on my main server and rerolled frank we are taking it one day at a time i live in henryville in “the veil separating the holy of holies from the rest of the tabernacle fell behind him again shutting him out for another year” we celebrated 's birthday sunday after and the man of the house got home from if she had a warning label it would

grateful dead and a lot of tanning lotion and a radio show host i actually enjoyed the beginning before it got into all the grateful dead stuff since i've never listened to the band and all the

died on april rd in pope john paul ii beatified her in in his encyclical on christian unity ut unum sint he presented her again to the whole church as a model of “the total and unconditional offering of one’s life to the father through the son in the holy spirit” knight also released her women's collection in and when preston passed away a couple of years ago she took over the business knight's designs take inspiration from th century old french priest coats edwardian frock coats and military jackets or antique silk and lace jackets blouses and skirts now that is my kind of designer i just stand there he has no pads of any kind he wants me to hit him in the chest and if i open my big mouth he says “look it’s just a game” i must dream that i’m asleep in the celebratory speech given by adams in which i think we can now assume was based largely on information supplied by foster himself he boasted of having been married five times and to have fathered children with the oldest daughter born c the last of these claims is obviously unrealistic if we now accept that he was born in and would have been a mere years old at the time while i have only found evidence for two children i accept there may well have been several others “maybe someone else will give you a try” we have had a very fun long weekend it started with a sleep over at gram and gramp's on thursday night all four kidos john and i enjoyed a kidless date night something we aren't very good at i dropped the kids off then went and got a haircut we had dinner at javier's then went to a session at the bountiful temple it was so nice to enjoy the night together and not worry about getting back to the kids the best part was knowing they were having the time of their lives and not missing us a bit the next morning we even enjoyed sleeping in a bit then john went to work and i enjoyed breakfast with a friend i went to get the kids about and they were far from ready to go home i don't know that they were even excited to see me gram was spoiling them and they had an agenda of things to do before going home we had lunch pulled a sled behind the wheeler cut out cole's pinewood derby car played some more and finally headed for home around drew had a long nap and we had a fun night gram let us borrow home alone they watched and at their house which they couldn't wait to see they were all ready for bed when it was time cole and john had a sleep over upstairs cole was very happy wade into the ocean demolished the locusts of yesteryear's coo off live at generation records single i hate to say it but all i can do is sit back and watch this train wreck of a duo slowly tear apart this quirky and loving family that makes up the office there were different spices used in it's making i chose to stick close to ruston to do my internship and i took a job in healthcare marketing in east texas when i graduated i now work in monroe la managing grant development and community benefits programs for a hospital name zofia roblenska kohl we had a wonderful time visiting friends in il and we didn't take enough pictures we also didn't get to see everyone we wanted so i do apologize to those we missed we really tried to pack in as much visiting as we could it's a collection of recent interviews i did with children of actors from cinema’s golden age they talk about the joys and difficulties of growing up in the shadow of the early hollywood spotlight and when it comes to bad it surely doesn't get any worse than this culinary beauty lovely with or without boiled cabbage and pig's ears a crowd pleaser this one who's coming for dinner tonight you have to know how much i love jack’s mannequin and andrew mcmahon for me to attend this show sound academy is one of the worst venues in the city on a multitude of levels security staff are ignorant the layout is full of poor sightlines the sound’s not the best and the location is ridiculously inaccessible in a city that overall is quite the opposite but jack’s mannequin continues to book there on tours and i sigh and buy my ticket anyway because this is a band not to be missed my sleep kit mirrors my chopice for backpacking and i’ve rated the kit elsewhere on this blog the snooz is a real luxury that i wouldn’t do without though having tried numerous inflatable pillows with little success this beanbag pillow is truly comfortable

pull on everything around them but now it is like they are planets spinning off from their orbits nondirectional and ineffective one thing is women do not like other women they are competitive and suspicious i realize some women do have close relationships and that is good but most do not i am eve mother of every single living breathing person on this planet and i don’t have close female friends i want them but somehow it just does not happen i have acquaintances but that is not the same some years ago i wrote a poem about a moment in which god impressed upon my heart a prayer for our grandchildren you can read the poem here a birthday moment it had been a long time since i had read the poem but i recently found it again accidentally while searching my blog for a poem by someone else this poem of mine was written about the four of my grandchildren who were present at the time now there are quite a few more this time i was bent upon finishing all the baking decorating and shopping a day before r's big day i couldn't afford to miss on anything and then have a panic attack at the last minute i have had enough of those and i'm not up for any more of it so days before their big day we both sat down and sorted out all what we bought i was telling jobin that i love doing such stuffs and that it reminded me of my birthday parties appan amma used to host when i was a

that rule to the blow torch so when i turned round to accept it from a chinese girl with singed eyebrows the blue flame licked all the hairs off my arm our train was set for cinque terra which i think

world rather than observing from the outside i have to add my own perspectives a large part of the college experience is what somebody makes of it whether this is socially or academically focusing specifically on the academic realm there are many paths an individual can choose to follow the freedom to create a personalized course load allows students to tailor a semester’s academic rigor to the degree they so choose it is often a personal and conscience choice to take specific classes with the course load as some factor in the decision fill the basket of baking paper or aluminium foil which

oakridge neighborhood margaret brunner i have always tried to use different mediums and create different textures and one of the books i got today see the bit about the library at the beginning wasn’t pointless i have some good ideas of things i want to try dear sweets but then a friend had her book trashed on a blog review site by someone claiming to have found a huge number of editingtypographical errors ‘i’m an editor’ the reviewer wrote ‘if i’d been editing this it wouldn’t have happened’ the aim would be to establish a nature preserve open to hikers nature lovers and educational groups police then continued to pursue the rallygoers down several streets amid chaotic scenes which saw violence from both sides over the next four hours my standard response to this response about police mental health awareness training – every single time – is that such claims may well be true but mental health and social care professionals needs more “police awareness training” around procedures and law most amhps i’ve met can’t explain s properly for example – although many can most mental health nurses on wards who are asking for patients to be arrested following assaultative behaviour don’t realise that we arrest people to commence and investigative and criminal justice process not for the convenience of nhs staff if there is no complaint of an offence or no evidence of liability arrests don’t occur however desirable someone may think that would be you should see the list of people i’d arrest in a fantasy world where we do it because i think it would be a

at the moment i’m ramping up the running again and easing off the writing for a little bit… a bloomsbury time turner helps too… anyway in one way or another the idea that authors getting friends and family to reviewrate their books on amazon and goodreads is wrong crops up a few times of course it is i'm not disputing that whatsoever but it got me thinking about a few things that are only slightly related and i wanted to ask what people's views on them were and so here we have a discussion from the website ‘the national assembly for wales’s finance committee has opened a public consultation on a new inquiry examining aspects of financing and finding of devolution to be needed in the dark that is something to hook her heart and hold it fast until the light returns singer

would be just another painted wall on my first trip to the animal kingdom i was completely amazed by the tree of life for my young eyes the tree was a bit overwhelming and difficult to absorb in its entirety i was so distracted by the intricacy of the tree’s carvings that i failed to realize one of the tree’s secrets as i later discovered the tree houses an interactive show beneath its extensive root system the base of the tree conceals a theater with a d movie “it’s tough to be a bug” the interior of the theater was designed to resemble a darkened cave emphasizing the natural themes

coolidgerask's invention in the reconstruction and both reviews burke is openly himself throughout he is even shown investigating the mysterious death of roger balfour and deciding it was suicide then coming back five years later to prove it was murder the times reviewer pinpointed the howling illogic of that burke of scotland yard the genius who wills to solve a murder mystery five years after he has declared it to be a case of suicide silence then gives rise to even more active communication requiring sensitivity and a capacity to listen that often makes manifest the true measure and nature

pattern out of bounds it’s locker room time adieu it all started rather innocently just before finals in december i was a wee bit stressed over the thought of exam essays and needed a slight diversion i began with a small farm and planted crops that were ready to harvest in hours this was the beginning of my morning ritual which involved harvesting and then planting as i had my morning coffee and cigarette update and just as i start making jokes about stds i lay eyes on this i dunno that this untreatable gonorrhea business is particularly new though we've had untreatable stds from the uglyembarrassing herpes to the lethal aids for decades but we really really need new antibiotics and the morons in charge are too busy harassing the drug companies to be bothered with things like

daady died and i’m so worried because he went to the rainbow bridge without his wheelchair he needs that chair and moomie just took it to a place called goodwill if they really have good will they’d bring it back and bawl my moomie out for leaving it there it sounds radical but in terms of knowledge and learning i don’t think it is really incredibly radical to say that schools are not as necessary as they used to be but then the way that they are necessary will continue to be valid until society changes dramatically in other economic wayspeople need their kids to be in school because they are workingso it’s hard to imagine a world without school before imagining a world in which jobs have been dramatically restructured night's opening wide no more word of mouth or current tsp smoked paprika i've outgrown my current storage system i thought i had this under control by using these ikea racks to hold my mostly used punches it is clear from all these issues that fundamentally the building was poorly designed the main problem with the building is that although an example of modernist architecture it is not a good one gkc are a respected architectural firm who have completed some incredible projects and although i am not attempting to destroy their reputation we need to accept that they are not untouchable perhaps it has something to do with an exaggerated sense of diplomacy inherent in the give and take of energy is a kind of aggressive submissive implication that maybe some people aren't comfortable with so instead they utilize a very pc approach where it is encouraged that neither partner encroach on the others' selfsufficiency at least to the degree to which it is possible to be unobtrusive i think this may stem from our cultural ideal of individuality and selfreliance and also perhaps a heightened sensitivity to the notion of equality of the sexes and a subsequent aversion to welldefined masculine and feminine roles and that aversion also seems to imply an aversion to the emotional character of the dance the desire between man and woman or between same sexes for those with that inclination which results in a dance that may certainly be expressive and beautiful but emotionally inert but perhaps this is a line of thought that is veering off on a tangent from the topic of this post how i wish i too could embrace this identity it sucks all those i yearn to speak with are strangers…i’m far too strange turmoil in the region has already forced up the price of crude oil affecting the global economy that is already struggling to escape recession and that i have to look at it immediatelyteacher in any case the show delivered and it delivered good i admit that it might not be everyone’s cup of tea my roommate wasn’t sold but i can find very little to complain about the story lines and scenes are awkward and unapologetic and they actually talk about things year old women talk about as much as i love “new girl” nothing about the show is realistic or all that relatable besides the fact that perhaps a lot of us ladies understand her awkward lovability… so it’s kind of nice to see a show where you aren’t necessarily promised a happy ending or at least the happy ending is as tenuous and uncertain as all of ours are these tin foil paintings were fun i wrapped and taped a piece of tin foil to the back of card stock sheets i made sure the kids all had aprons for this project we used bright colored acrylic paint and foam paint brushes in spring in summer with daffodils on one side then legal advice and faculty pressure suggest that brodhead will continue with his january line of wholeheartedly defending the group of at this stage the question would seem to be whether pressure from alumni or prospective parents will force him to reconsider this approach in practice however this lack of any establishing narrative swiftly turns the raid into a tedious exercise a repetitive display of martial arts prowess that

it could have been different but it is not when talking about ethnicity in one of my classes one student tried to tell me about his heritage… the idea of selfdefinition also comes up in a conversation with a prostitute who the driver gives a lift to one night throughout this conversation the camera remains trained on the driver never showing the prostitute's face focusing on the driver's reactions to this other woman's thoughts about her profession the prostitute seems to think in a way that's surprisingly similar to the driver advocating independence and freedom from the constricting routines of marriage and monogamy she's jaded because she's seen men take phone calls from their wives sign off with i love you and then go to bed with her as a result she sees women who tie themselves to a man as foolish echoing the driver's own advice to a friend who defined herself exclusively in terms of a man and was devastated when he left her for someone else statesvillemooresville is a key

otherwise black and white picture i like the idea of someone’s eyes being drawn to a splash of color in a picture full of grey black and white it’s also not really hard to do lol which is a bonus but i also believe that maybe it can be just a gimmick that helps people turn a boring picture into something a bit more artsy as i did with this picture of the motercyle this was by no means the first time that similar allegations had been made against a team of american sportsmen including previous charges of interracial rape yet these had never led to similar scenes this was however the first time that the allegations had been made by a black woman against a group of white sportsmen we finally decided on clear plexiglass as the covering this time in our lives is all about media social networking for some and i will include myself here it has become almost an addiction for some reason knowing what other people are doing uploading pictures gaming blogging texting watching youtube videos has become more important than what is currently happening in our homes in our relationships and even our jobs and we are not the only ones affected by this addiction our children our spouses suffer the most i am delighted to agree with this conclusion which answers my previous criticisms about the biston story but we have to remember that the evidence for natural selection never rested entirely—or even substantially—on the bird predation experiments but rather on the datasets documenting allele frequency changes that were consistent parallel on two continents and then reversed when the environment changed what was important about the birdpredation experiments especially the one discussed here is that they identified the agent of selection today will be like most days

never felt flat though the motivations underlying the ‘printing’ of new group memberships ie the issuing of citizenship or equivalent status are clearly different a partial analogy can be drawn in terms of the effects in a country like japan which has yet to develop an interest in allowing mass immigration from the developing world citizenship group membership in the japanese nation is remarkably clearcut to be japanese is to be a member of that ethnic linguistic and cultural community located on the japanese archipelago though it is possible in principle to obtain japanese citizenship it is extremely difficult and timeconsuming and will not result in one being thought of as japanese by the japanese why not because one would simply not be japanese irrespective of government or media propaganda to the contrary propaganda which does not exist this state of affairs in which the conditions for citizenship are universally agreed upon by group members and not undergoing nonorganic topdown attempts at revision can be likened to a stable currency in japan japanese citizenship is a solid gold coin its value unquestioned in social transactions and to be honest

three elements is missing we have failed to obey god the way we should king saul provides us with a perfect example of this in samuel he was told to wait for samuel to give a burnt offering and peace offerings to the lord before he fought the philistines in battle after it had been seven days however and samuel hadn’t come saul decided to make the offerings himself it wasn’t that burnt offerings were displeasing to the lord and saul said he made the offering to seek the favor of the lord v but the disobedience came with saul acting before samuel came to give him instruction as he was told in response to this disobedience samuel says “you have done foolishly you have not kept the commandment of the lord your god with which he commanded you… now your kingdom shall not continue” vv it’s only

check out the article cozy socks on chilly days but driving to work today—sitting in traffic meditation—something occurred to me if every conference we attend has a theme the theme of this one was not a series of unfortunate events but how unschoolers respond to suffering so that men will say rambo mentions how this will motivate him to work even harder to attain a higher draft grade but he doesn’t mention if this work will be in the red and black or in various training sessions preparing for the combine or individual team workouts what a decision he’s facing and i’m both excited and terrified for him but in the end i wish bacarri the best of luck with whatever he decides haven't heard about uni yet but not holding my breath as it is very hard to get in and they get a lot of applicants and

geographical indication' the department has received feedback from a number of organizations including inta interpat oppi ipa ficci etc all the responses can be accessed over here the most interesting submissions in my opinion is from the 'officials of the delhi patent office' not only have these officials questioned the practice of outsourcing examinations to the csir they have also criticized the quality of examinations conducted by the csir these officials have also made some interesting recommendations on improving the internal systems of the patent office their submissions can be accessed over here they never hurt a hair of him they only let him die ya that's what i thought our new church has been wonderful we picked the city based on the church it is exactly what we wanted and we couldn't be happier we are meeting new friends very quickly we finally have an overlap of school church and activities within the city businesses also fail because of a poor or nonexistent business

paxil and amitriptyline the report concluded that her behavior at that meeting was very similar to the behavior she exhibited on the night of the party that so sad and heavy now is oh yeah our valentines dance last night was pretty fun the kids really enjoyed it they had great decorations games that the kids liked and ice cream sundaes and cookies that my kids loved we stayed for about an hour and then came back home i did get a few pics but my stupid camera wasn't taking clear pictures you know i think i should just go out and buy a cheap one from walmart at least that way it would fit in my purse and i'd have it when i needed it and those take decent pictures to get a camera that takes fabulous pictures you need to spend more than that's just the cold hard facts i'm afraid “i cloned the sheriff yes” said the presidential clone “but i did it or national defence” i still love cooking baking and making photo's but there are some realities as well to be faced we're in situation of economy crisis in belgium ie the price of gas electricity go so high too high the price of gasoline is up in months time and off course not to mention the prices of freshfood go along with others but the salary stays the same now we're trying to cut the expenses by lowing the use of electricity car so here i am with less cooking and baking and also less going around with the car so close but so far away omer is a midfielderforward who should give the seawolves another speedy player up front molly cate my snake phobia which has been everpresent in my life has gotten markedly worse the hills of northern california are known for being prime rattlesnake territory and several friends who enjoy hiking have alerted me that the rattlers are definitely out and about already this spring in fact most of my hiker friends have seen at least one if not two snakes per hike during the last month i have been strongly advised to stay off trails until the weather gets cooler something i'm more than happy to do although i'll miss running at tilden my father has always been very christian and conservative – and if you meet him you would never know it unless you asked him he does not go to church every sunday he does not sing songs about god to express his love for him he doesn’t tally his points toward heaven by counting prayers or good deeds he is just good no need to check off the itemized rulebook of “how be a christian” he knows the book and he understands the ideas he does not shove his thoughts on modern issues unless asked he is at peace this way he is a good man who shows his faith and strength of character in his actions isn’t that what everyone wants to be at peace and know what they stand for to make friends and not enemies my father has perfected this i look up to his calm confident tolerance more than he will ever know we are on opposite sides of the same coin but we both realize that it’s the same coin we are happy in our own ways while living together harmoniously damn that was cliché whatever… resolutions only show what you intend the wealthy often intrude on the processes of politics for their own benefit their power comes from money itself and the rest of the population has no countervailing power which is itself an inherent danger some of the wealthy routinely seek control of the very laws and regulations under which their wealth is generated this antidemocratic tendency is dangerous because favoritism can become implanted in the law favoritism in the law differs only in degree from extractive monopoly the thing is orange is one of those colours that sneaks up and seduces you with its wit charm and humorous take on life it's like hugh grant it's a colour cad that's never around for long but it's fun when it does appear so i suspect tangerine might take us all by surprise this year i was watching that poignant parisian episode of sex and the city last night an american girl in paris part deux and there was a fabulous bright orange panelled wall in one of the scenes with aleksandr petrovsky it immediately made me want to repaint our summer library in a cheeky mandarin shade “shelby” interestingly right after the river there was this hut with some souvenirs and informational materials about all that blm lands around and about the highway you can even get a certificate that you reached the arctic circle on the other side of the highway there was an eating placestoreshowergasolineand probably a place to stay – basically what a road sign calls services we’ve had lunch there consisting mostly of burgers it was already raining drizzling mostly “the focus of the homestay programme is not merely about accommodation but also showcases malaysia’s rich cultural heritage lifestyle in a unique and interesting manner” gratitude it’s no secret that i believe gratitude is important and there isn’t a moment that goes by during the day when i do not say ‘thank you’ to one of my children for whatever they are doing it is literally at the end of nearly every sentence i speak to them and most other people i come in contact with when you approach a person or situation from a state of gratitude like love you acknowledge and validate the individual or experience as having value and purpose red skirt goodwill elsie was by far my favourite performer of the night her quirky stage presence and fashion sense made her overall performance more captivating every one of her songs had a catchy “arctic monkeysesque” bass line to it but which didn’t overshadow her amazing vocals she performed her first single “the assassin bang bang” amongst her other songs including “dangerous dog” “time to go” and “london town” elsie has an official website and youtube channel you can also follow her on twitter officialelsie i had fun making this little birthday cake for one year old wynn i iced the cake nice and smooth with pink buttercream and then went to town with the fondant accents i cut out the cupcake shapes and the polka dots and even made a gumpaste plaque and for the second tier smash cake she coped very well with the hourlong trip in the back of the truck that she shared with the rest of her family and even though we had a number of stops along the way she was very glad to finally get out and really stretch her legs even though she did not compete she coped very well with the gunshot and watched everything with the same intensity as her granddam did when she was a puppy we practised our heeling amidst all the distractions and also practised sitting quietly at heel watching the dogs working she accepted fairly long periods of tethering while i was working one or other of the dogs which is a very important part of her learning particularly since i will always have more than one dog to run and will from time to time be expected to judge we bade fond farewells and said our goodbyes when questioned the white house office of management and budget “omb” admitted it had edited the statements but insisted that “coaching” and “providing consistency” in witnesses testimony was “standard practice” the big grey rat ran to the end of the wall wheeled around and came back

brooklyn is chocolate flavored there is a bronx egg cream strawberry and i've heard of a san fransisco egg cream which is hazelnut “plain” mike chuckled back at him “i’m pretty sure the kid likes

kid in the neighborhood these steps may be more difficult to implement after elections and the accompanying shuffle in characters but it does seem as though the time is right for focusing on improvements to human rights standards i think ngo's and stakeholders should use this momentum and the spotlight of the eu to mount additional pressure on the government to do something other than signing agreements and publicizing them we spent the rest of the weekend together lounging about with paul who’s really cool and has an incredible imagination we talked about all sorts of metaphysical shit and paul told me to “always trust the universe” i like that thought although sometimes i think things need to be taken into one’s own hands paul who’s an english bloke also taught me lots of british sayings such as “knock your tits off” he also called me a “rum chick” whatever that means my bud baby lovebug snuggle bunny pumpkin pie looove my sweet baby boy he will always be my baby boy even when he's he was chatting and singing while i shot these hence the constant state of openness that his mouth is exhibiting fast forward another couple of years and sadly i developed some much more serious medical problems thankfully i made it through those too however as a way to deal with the shock of that serious illness i reevaluated my approach to food and drink brewers association first one publishing's writing contest this contest was intended to promote a brandnew publishing venture and it accomplished its goalin the wrong wayby requiring entrants to surrender all rights to

fresh raw tomatoes i have tried numerous times but i just do not like them if they're in a salsa or bruschetta i can eat them but just cut up and tossed into a salad or in a sandwich no thank you the thing is you’re having a good time sharing your knowledge about these people and their issues this knowledge is incontrovertible it’s been backed up in media representation books research and lots and lots of historical events also your own unassailable sense of being right use in recipes where you would use cream will require a patent flirtin' with disaster art supported me today he got up early to pick me up he was involved the entire day i was playing giving me tips correcting my moves the witness of previous generations of scholars is reviewed surrounded by imaginary pyrotechnics shape mine her family and all patients who battle cancer continue to need prayers i have become catlike in my aversion to being physically unsettled or have i always been i have increasingly rejected the traps and trappings of the maturing organism but gathering the comforts of home around me—that’s something else entirely gen in a small bowl combine the confectioners' sugar and enough milk to achieve smooth dipping consistency dip cookies then roll in coconut place on waxed paper let stand until set i haven’t weighed in this week and don’t plan to i’m still going to attend the meeting in fact i need to be getting ready right about now between my “friend” and how i’ve eaten this week i just don’t want to face the number on the scale i still need to go and participate in the meeting though your workmanship is marvelous—how well i know it this simple shift in thinking can change your life and your lifestyle……… and aren’t you worth it yes you are i need to get going but i hope to see you at the show i ripped off the fabric and this is what we had when i originally bought it was green and white zebra striped i felt judged by the cashier for buying it and i didn't blame herit was that kinda ugly i painted it white before i mod podged it last time but you can still kinda see the zebra stripes there's only one thing we know for sure even if some of us don't feel comfortable admitting it they are like all muslimseven the best of themmentally enslaved to the mentality of a savage seventh century death cult and the only peace possible to achieve with them is going to require the shedding of a hell of a lot more blood than has thus far been shed how old are you here’s the original cut fyi password is zenith really difficult i know ive just hidden it until the directors cut premières but also it made me think it made me reassess how i do parent and made me look more carefully at why i parent as i do and the outcome i’ve become even more freerange if that’s the mentality of others out there – paranoid terrified helicopterish to the max – then i know i have to continue with freerange thinking and parenting more than ever to ensure that my daughters grow up to be confident strong and capable and to look at the world knowing that dangers do not lurk around every corner that most people are good and that they themselves are competent here are some resources for you to check out after a long stalemate parties agreed in early november to integrate a maximum of combatants in a specially created directorate under the na subsequently the former fighters were categorised into three groups after a detailed interview process around of them opted for integration and the rest chose to voluntarily retire with cash incentives only a handful picked rehabilitation packages in early february those who opted for retirement left the cantonments so thanks to your suggestions we spent this weekend trying everything imaginable to coax this kid into position including gary that all sounds super fab i feel special to be part of an exclusive club i've never been part of a club like this one and just think maybe one day it'll be so prestigious that people will want to be part of it but they'll have to show that they are fun enough to be part of our club like a sororityfraternity minus some of the nudity hell week and having to get bailed out of jail by your dad for

wedding after the celebrations we were off to hawaii for a much needed relaxing beach holiday after which we did a wonderful cruise of the great barrier reef before flying home via singapore what a great trip that was and one day i’ll put some more photos up for you to see “my darling of course i love you you are my world my light my everything if you were not in my life well i wouldn’t know what to do my heart would be torn asunder split like the firewood between calder’s lumber axe why must you ask such silly things” could i ever have something so complex heroman watches jonny fall anna thank you so much for taking the time to visit with me i wish you continued success in all your endeavors like… i have almost in my house i hope that everyone in writemotivation is off to a good start i will see about getting around to see your checkins soon myself max factor angel pink lipstick inspired and mainly made from this eating well recipe the original recipe was for shrimp and pea risotto being as my dad is allergic to shellfish and we already had a main entree i just used the recipe as a guide for flavor and yes i did sub in edamame for regular peas the peas my parents had in the freezer looked a bit dried up we were pretty beside ourselves we didn't expect a tour of the house so imagine when he asked if we wanted to see inside the garage i think i might have pinched myself at that point to make sure i wasn't dreaming lol mike has been wanting to pick up his blog again so he's entertaining the thought of having a life style blog too including toby dad outfit posts how cute would that be i really hope he goes through with it because it just sounds fantastic he may need some encouraging though i had so much fun playing with this software that i finally had to just stop and write this review nor do you want to read about my efforts in the office for himself housework nah let's not even go there in this discussion but if you rang my doorbell right now i would only be embarrassed by the state of the house versus my normal mortified yes a time i feel sure when che guevara trotsky and marx stared out from the walls of thousands of dirty bedsits these avatars of an ideology and political practice in every way as abhorrent as fascism more abhorrent if the calculus of death plays any part in the assessment of such things one respondent to the bright article makes the same point i switched lenses a couple of times during our walk but i think in the end that most photos came from the mm given i only have two lenses i’m not sure i can call it a ‘favourite’ as yet but it’s getting a fair amount of use once again i was switching between af and mf as af only really seems to want to lock in on something if it is obvious – i haven’t spent time with the manual to find out if there is a better way to get the camera to reselect the focus point on my old camera it would usually work by depressing the shutter button to the halfway point over and over until it found the correct spot but it doesn’t seem to work so obviously with the d anyway you can see from the photo below how it misses just enough to be quite annoying you’re also the only person who can make me smile bob gass writes ‘word for today’ and frequently encourages us to be thankful and to forgive he also writes on other issues which are key to our mental health and wellbeing modesty says she was flattered that’s right all of the glory and none of the pain in a small kitchen even a simple pie crust is typically out of the question really anything that requires rolling out dough usually gets vetoed so when my good friend vanessa shared this recipe with me i knew i’d found my perfect match it’s called a “swedish” apple pie post and i finished a discovery of witches as well before you seriously begin a real estate investment make sure you consider the real risks that you would be taking with a venture like that a new investor is likely to learn the hard way that there are serious downsides to being new to the game take time to gain knowledge about real estate investing before you put your money on the line in new york robby andrews became the first prep ever under in the with his stunning win how good is this mark he's now faster indoors than the last three outdoor record holders michael granville george kersh and pete richardson and prep mile record holder alan webb with these four as my guide i'm thinking we will see great things from mr andrews this outdoor season seriously i should start a dating website where we all describe our friends recommendedbymecom in just one sentence we've got kind employed quirky athletic and adventurous how could i possibly say no the frame is a frame from michaels it's been painted with acrylic paint crackle distress paint and distress inked easy but fun it's been a long walk since i last wrote in this blog maybe it takes that long sometimes to live enough to have something to say then the market for young adult novels changed no longer were publishers interested in coming of age stories that were gentle in tone despite the tough circumstances my characters experienced instead they wanted “edgy” dystopian tales of life in a bleak landscape stories about teen prostitutes drug abuse alcoholism stories featuring vampires werewolves and zombies stories that i could not imagine handing to my young nieces stories that i had no desire to write you can have this experience at home with forever's stovetop espresso maker using a pressurized steam system to force pressurized gaseous water through the coffee beans you won't be able to tell its espresso from store bought it's so good in fact that world espresso champion drea du mandionne always takes one with her when she is camping her taste is unimpeachable so this is clearly a quality item maybe the reason i am so not looking forward to school this week is because a it’s midterms week and b for once i had a fun weekend so i made them three different ways and to tell you the truth all were delicious so there we sat in the corner like two angela martin's from the office contemplating risking our lives to ditch the party unfortunately it was just too late and would have been too reckless on our part to release ourselves to the sea of drunk drivers that inevitably owned the road three beautiful things this week was inspired by a wonderful blog that clare writes called three beautiful things everyday clare writes about beautiful things that happen each day in her life it's a wonderful blog i can only hope to imitate her in a very small way i shared this earlier today at my grandmother’s funeral service or let me invite you into my tent bring me your book i will open it wide and tell you what secrets of yours it reveals or go not i hang out with denise and her friends in a scene that’s all new to me techno music free parties in abandoned warehouses late nights that carry into the next afternoon and catandmouse games with the police officers who are attempting to enforce the latest freepartykilling version of the uk criminal justice act every weekend and sometimes during the week denise plays big mama to the squatters anarchists crusties and exjunkies who come round to her flat in finsbury park the problem is i cant do that unless i lose lbs “he said i like the way he looks” lewis schaffer continued “because in this country

can't give up on zenn the wife and i ask for bells two hearted but they were out so i just figured i would shoot for something i've never seen before not much in the way of local area beer i've never had before so we roll with it as the three grew larry couldn’t live in comfort knowing that his father has maybe or maybe not survived the battle against the garden gnomes until one day a letter came along by owl and enclosed in the letter was a golden bracelet which he had to go to the country of saddamamort to throw into the burning oil wells and destroy upon the destruction of this bracelet the wars of central earth would cease and all the people that are wired by their heads into every outlet in the pink flamingos power lines will be freed and allowed to live as normal men of central earth instead of living as a ‘renewable energy source’ there’s no business like show business everything about it is appealing and of course nowhere can you get that happy feeling i would also like to share another scene this one is from the cartoon series avatar the last airbender it's the scene in the third book what they called seasonsseries' where aang and katara dance it's more of a choreographed fight than an actual dance but it still looks amazing it was actually watching this scene that inspired me to make d dancing the presidents wife was reelected gbbf organiser wake up america whit was

your local business online anymore so in creating this open group i would so love a place where other creatives with the same interests holidays and goals kindness and inspiration as stj could commingle and share in this holiday goodness together i believe the hive has given us the perfect venue to make this happen however in the two years that i’ve used pecksniff’s services i’ve had several charwomen tell me that she’s not very nice to work for it has also been apparent that they get no training these women seem to only continue in pecksniff's employment because their circumstances are dire and now that angela has worked here for over a year i’ve been able to glean a greater insight into the modus operandi of mistress pecksniff they exemplify the art of the

office cbo concludes that letting the bushera tax cuts expire on schedule would strengthen longterm economic growth on balance if policymakers used the revenue saved to reduce deficits in other words any negative impact on economic growth from increasing taxes on highincome people would be more than offset by the positive effects of using the resulting revenue gain to reduce the budget deficit tax

desires you can learn valuable lessons from the suffering you go through which will accomplish good purposes in your life through death you can experience life that includes blessings such as

told them and that is where my gratification comes in this is of course only if i don’t like the person asking the dumb question it’s never good to lie unless you really don’t like the person you’re

defaults there are some ‘victims’ of this economic downfall who knew they bought more house than they could afford who knew that they didn’t have true job ‘security’ but gambled with the odds anyway

with sundry details that you can easily find elsewhere the important thing is that many people have found inspiration in this cocktail whether drinkers or bartenders the corpse has provoked the creation of new cocktails as numerous bartenders have riffed on its proven recipe these variations can stand on their own all of them are unnumbered and therefore their corpse reference passes unacknowledged in a series of posts i plan on further exploring these homages to the corpse i am sure i will miss some but it will be a fitting ode to one of my favorite drinks then she said disown me and never talk to me again she had not factored in a storm speak to the advantages disadvantages and challenges of the technology so the teachers and students have a context to think about it drove over a branch that lay in her path but i'm short on sleep and i'm tired and most nights i go to bed feeling like an utter failure because there is always so much that didn't get done that day the work is never done and my personal commitments are suffering i have nothing left for my family except snarky comments about the housework that didn't get done while i was working the only one who gets any

cope with the world amanda culbreath is the california state juniorjunior fiddle champion and under time to draw some conclusions the kinds of economic and sustainability issues surrounding today’s virtual archives are not the ones that concerned scholars working in the predigital age instead for those professors and graduate students the main economic issues consisted of having the funds and time needed to travel to the archives while travel expenses remain legitimate needs today access to commercial subscription databases funds to support one’s own digital projects and the feasibility of embarking on such a project for pretenured scholars have emerged as pressing economic concerns similarly in the past academic libraries created and maintained archives for users admittedly often with some faculty consultation and collaboration yet today more and more professors graduate students and even some advanced undergraduates not only use archives but they also build them and must plan for their management growth and sustainability as well in doing so many enter into collaborative partnerships with libraries while others form part of an academic center devoted to digital work some digital archives aim to reach more than an academic audience and instead afford a space for public humanities and in almost all cases our experiences working with searchable sometimes multimedia archives cannot help but color our forays into traditional archives yet what ed folsom has deemed “database as genre the epic transformation of archives” and other theoretical reconsiderations of “archives” are subjects for a followup post and while audiences pulsated to the swirling lights in the throes of lsd bands would materialize onstage often in long jam sessions it should be no surprise

protection act and this will not be shared with the trust except where required to support a formal appeal against an allocation decision this was a major issue for the lct as it was felt important that trustees were not compromised by knowledge of tenant personal and financial information i looked at the clock again it was am but that was fine breakfast would be served until i could sleep for another four hours but then i heard drums announcements made through a tannoy cars honking i had fallen back asleep and in the haze of coming around what i first thought of were the stories of the

stepped up in class at ascot on december in the grade two noel novices’ chase over two miles and three furlongs and jumped his opponents silly from the front with his only mistake coming at the last when he had the race wrapped up he was turned out quickly eight days later at kempton’s christmas meeting in the grade two wayward lad novices’ chase but he was very disappointing pulling up before the third last this was the first of three disappointing performances at kempton over fences in deep purple’s career to date and evan williams revealed he bled on every occasion after a short absence he returned to the racecourse in early march at sandown where he finished second in a fourrunner novices’ chase but he soon got back on track with an easy victory at hereford days later on his next start he lined up at aintree’s john smith’s grand national meeting in the grade two john smith’s manifesto novices’ chase and put up a bold display only finding tartak too good he bagged his second grade two success of the season at ayr in the future champion novices’ chase routing his rivals to score by nine lengths the bay gelding returned in fine fettle for the season capturing the grade two charlie hall chase at wetherby and the grade two peterborough chase at huntingdon on his first two starts however a return to kempton for the king george vi chase over christmas saw him break a blood vessel and he was pulled up before the tenth he wasn’t seen again until march in the grade one ryanair chase at the cheltenham festival but he put in a much improved display to finish fourth to the classy albertas run that rival took the spoils again at aintree in the grade one john smith’s melling chase but deep purple was beaten over twice as far in sixth suggesting he didn’t run up to his best form he reappeared in october for the charlie hall chase but he could not emulate his victory from the year before and finished a stayingon third over the threemile trip unfortunately he unseated on his next outing in the rearranged peterborough chase at newbury in mid december however he put in a more encouraging display in february g white lotus paste so what next how about a place to dine

this part of myself that has lead me to fall head over heals in love way too quickly and in turn led to recurring heartbreak this is the part of me that used to be way too eager to trust and in turn brought me to countless disappointments this is the part of my personality that has gotten me arrested on occasion – i’m sure we’ll get into this at some later date – and has even landed me in the emergency room on at least two occasions that i can remember yes this is the part of me that is often easy to anger upset annoy intrigue amuse surprise elate piss off sympathize grieve panic and

principles apply you are the consumer and a good is being supplied it is important to get value for money it’s not a case of what you “feel” like eating at the time you need to think of the bigger picture lunch time afternoon tea evening meal what will you be in the mood for then then there is the added pressure of loved ones at home if they know you will be attending a bake sale there is the expectation that you will bring back baked goods you then have to think about what they would like to eat if you can’t handle this sort of pressure i suggest you keep your mouth shut and keep the bake sale to yourself a oh there are so many things that are wonderful it is a constant ever changing world of color and design it is tactile and makes me want to constantly create and sew i love being surrounded by the most amazing artists who truly understand the need to be creative on a daily basis just like i do massive attack dissolved girl i'm sure this book doesn't need any introduction given
